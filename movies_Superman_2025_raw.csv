"Okay, obviously Clark, Lois, and Lex were great, but can I please highlight Mr. Terrific, who was a surprise standout for me? Knew nothing about this character going in but ended up loving him so much, his every line delivery was so entertaining.

“I don’t need your help, I’m goddamn Mr. Terrific!”

It doesn’t hurt that the man has a solo GotG3 hallway fight lmao"
The fact that Superman was angry because of what happened with Krypto and surrendered himself just to save him was so goddamn endearing like that absolutely NAILED his character
Hawkgirl straight up murdered the president of a foreign country.
Cannot get over just how much every woman except Lois desperately wants to fuck Jimmy Olsen
It’s so funny when Supergirl shows up and you’re just immediately like oh… that’s why Kryptos like that lmaooo
"""Why are you doing this, Lex?""

""BECAUSE I *HATE* YOU!"""
Lex pointing to Ultraman to flip the light switch! 😂
"The flying dog isn't the most unrealistic thing in this movie.

It's the fact, when the evidence against the criminal billionaire comes out, people accept it and turn on him."
"Mr. Terrific getting dumped of Krytpo and commando rolling straight into a ""kickin' ass and taking names"" strut, is the superhero landing I didn't know I needed."
Lex Luthor having monkeys type hate tweets about Superman is so accurate LMAO
Can we talk about Guy just bonking the inter-dimensional eyeball thing with a giant green bat in the background?
"Lois: You have a dog  
Superman: He's not even that good a dog  
  
Shots fired at the movie's unquestioned MVP, Krypto."
Nicholas Hoult was incredible as Lex.
"Nicholas Hoult was incredible as Lex Luthor.

This Lex is so hateable and pathetic, and the film never wants you to feel anything different. From using all his connections to broadcast the Krypton message and damage his image, to that scene where he simply kills Mali and brushes it off like it's nothing. That makes the scene where he sheds a tear so satisfying."
"A lot of things to talk about, but I want to highlight Jonathan's talk with Clark. Probably my favorite scene in the film. Pruitt Taylor Vince may not have much screentime (like less than 5 minutes), but he makes it all count. 

I'm glad that Gunn avoided Jonathan's death before Clark becomes Superman like in the 1978 film, *Smallville* or *Man of Steel*. Good to see he's still alive to see his son's actions. He better come back with a larger screentime in the future."
I already adore Milly Alcock's Super Girl
Absolutely loved Mr Terrific's scenes
Anybody else think it was weird how Mr. Terriffic was so quick to dismiss Superman saying the 2nd half of Jor El's message was possibly fake. He's like no way I've forensics friends its 100% real xoxox like wtf was that all about?!
Favorite line delivery of the movie is Jimmy Olsen screaming “Jesus Christ” after Eve offhandedly tells him that Lex tortured a dog yesterday.

"The rows of monkeys writing tweets killed me

And I am sorry Jimmy i didn't know youre game"
"Can’t believe this movie had monkeys on computer tweeting 

#SuperShit"
"I'd like to thank whoever it was that dug up Gunn's tweets way back when.

Without you, we wouldn't be here.

Edit: Few too many responses about ""cancel culture"", from people who [don't actually remember what happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn#Firing_from_Disney_and_reinstatement). The ""mob"" was supporting him."
NOT HIM HAVING LITERAL MONKEYS RAGEBAITING ONLINE HOLY SHIT LMAOOO.
"Mr. Terrific could carry his own movie/show. He was so good. 
Best part of the movie for me."
"Also, did I mishear or did Supergirl say “Thanks for looking after my dog, bitch”??"
I kind of don’t buy that Jor-El sent Kel El to conquer earth and multiply. I think the Luther’s got it mistranslated as the way the translation sounded was off in its wording.
Felt very Saturday morning cartoon live action in a good way. Loved Supe's corny speeches and righteous anger at pointless suffering. Cheesy. It exactly in the way a Superman movie should be. Made me want to immediately go home and watch The Batman.
The way we were all hoping track 7 meant a Pattison Batman appearance just for it to be the president of Boravia’s portal theme lmao
"Loved this.

Just so unabashedly comic booky and overflowing with earnestness and hope.
Probably a little too overpacked with a bit too much going on, but it ends on such a strong note that they felt like minor quibbles haha. The ending montage with his family really got to me.

As much as I have a soft spot and love for Man of Steel and Henry Cavill it's great to finally push past self serious brooding superman and have him as goody two shoes full of heart type character again.

David Corenswet is fantastic and brings so much warmth and humanity to the role. Plus some insane chemistry with Rachel Brosnahan haha. Loved Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luther. Just so wonderfully petty heh.

Great stuff"
"Fun detail I noticed: Lex has assigned each Ultraman move with a specific ordered code, likely logged each one algorithmically since it's Unicode (Number followed by Letter). The ground and pound punch he repeatedly uses on Supes when he's weakened is coded 1A, the FIRST entry. Which means Lex Luthor hated Superman so much that the FIRST move he logged for his eventual fight with him after cloning Ultraman was punching him while he was down. Just brilliant subtext."
"I wish there was more to the Ultraman reveal. The moment the fortress revealed itself to Lex, I figured Ultraman was a Superman clone."
"Every character had a chance to shine, but Mister Terrific definitely steals the movie next to Krypto!

The scene that stuck out to me was where >!one of the Jarhanpur civilians was holding a cinderblock over his head like it was nothing!<"
"I have the biggest grin on my face after seeing this. It was so wonderfully, unashamedly comic booky.

Lex has a pocket universe with shitposting monkeys? Absolutely.

The Justice Gang fights an Interdimensional Imp in the background of a conversation? Sure as shit they do.

It's probably the first comic book movie in a while that felt like a comic book come to life.

Corenswet was brilliant as Superman. He brought the good hearted nature of Superman to the forefront and rocked every scene. Him saving that bloody squirrel during the Kaiju battle was so wonderful to see.

Brosnahan was perfect as Lois as well. She brought the fire to the role and was amazing in that interview scene (which was one of my favourite scenes in the entire movie).

And Hoult was incredibly vile as Luthor. **THIS** is the Luthor I've been waiting for on screen. He was petty, cruel, vindictive and everything Luthor should be.

The rest of the cast was great too. The action popped and the humour landed across the board. This is probably in my Top 5 comic book movies now. I absolutely loved it."
"There's good, there's bad. But my biggest takeaway from the movie is that it fundamentally gets Superman right. 


It's great to see Superman actually **want** to save people and not look like he's doing so begrudgingly. "
"Guy Gardener referring to superheroes as ""men of the cloth"" killed me. I wasnt expecting to like Guy Gardener so much lmao"
"The thing about James Gunn’s movies is that you can feel how heartfelt everything is. 

The underlying emotions.
The focus on one’s flaws.
Getting through a challenge with the help of friends.

Objectively, the movie felt uneven and rushed in some spots.
Subjectively, I just didn’t care about how uneven it was, and walked away with a bit of hope. 

A good time overall."
"One thing I didn’t get: If Lex had an evil clone of Supes and went through all this trouble to muddy the public image of Superman, why didn’t he just have the clone Superman do some evil stuff and be seen like killing people or talking to terrorists."
"The way I had tears in my eyes and a chill up my spine when the little boy held up the superman symbol flag in the face of the invading army, as well as during superman’s “I’m human” speech.. thank you James Gunn. You truly understand the character and what he stands for."
Superman’s speech to Lex gave me goosebumps.
"This movie was pure hopium, I loved it. Also holy shit, I am completely sold on Milly Alcock as Supergirl in the 10 seconds we saw her."
"Call me crazy, but there were some shots of Ultraman once he’s revealed to be a clone where he looks just like Henry Cavill"
DCU fox news immediately turning on Lex at the end... Wish the irl counterpart was that principled
"It took damn near two decades but WB finally found the perfect person to run DC in James Gunn.

Crazy to think if Disney never fired him and then rehired him for Guardians Vol 3, WB never would’ve got him to direct The Suicide Squad (that movie likely never would’ve happened) the Peacemaker show likely wouldn’t exist and they never would’ve offered him the position he has now. I’m glad because now the MCU and Kevin Feige finally has some real competition with him running things."
"Lex opened up a pocket dimension and put an entire army of keyboard typing monkeys there just so he can make people hate superman on Twitter. He has pure, rage filled tears in his eyes when losing a single fight against superman.

I absolutely aspire to be a pure hater like Lex Luthor. He doesn't even hate superman for a valid reason, he just does it for the love of the game."
This may be the first time I found an opening crawl successful in truly setting the scene and getting me amped for a movie.
Guy Gardner needs his own movie. James Gunn is just so good at translating comic book powers on the big screen.
"There is no way that Boravia vs. Jarhanpur wasn't just Israel vs. Palestine renamed, and the Serbian drug lord from the Pusher movies is Netanyahu"
Lois Lane is finally depicted perfectly.
"Damn, our guy really gives away his secret identity to a girl before they even say “I love you”."
"Superman is a great start to the DCU!

- The movie just shows a wall of text and drops you into middle of the action. Maybe movies start slow or maybe it is the short-attention spans nowadays but it definitely hooked the audience in.
- The first act was overloaded. There was a lot of worldbuilding, concepts, and information to grasp and the movie doesn't really slow down until the end of the first act.
- The second act and third act is more well-paced with a great finish
- David Corenswet is Superman! He embodied every aspect of Superman perfectly. There was very little Clark but that may be to leave room to explore in the future.
- Supporting cast was fantastic! Rachel Brosnahan channeling great reporter energy. Everyone else at least got their own moment to shine
- Lex Luthor was not a particularly big role but Nicholas Hoult brought his A-game and elevated the material, especially with the mug and pencils. Him shooting Mali definitely shocked me
- The anti-proton 'river' ending at the black hole in the 2nd act is peak comic book
- The movie has its comedic moments with Krypto and the peacemaker cameo got a lot of laughs
- The action and cinematography is very dynamic and works very well for Superman on screen. The editing is the only minus for me as it felt like there's 10 more minutes of movie left
- The Supergirl cameo at the end got a lot of attention from the audience and Milly Alcock was killed it in her cameo


Overall, the movie matched my high expectations and it lays the right foundation for the new DCU

P.S. They finally showed The Odyssey teaser and it was incredible!"
"This was a superman comic book brought to life. I loved the already established universe, the chemistry between Lois and Clark was phenomenal. The apartment interview scene might be my favourite of the movie. 

Edi as Mr. Terrific and Hoult as Lex are the standouts for me. The pure hatred Lex has shown in the movie, you could feel it, and David as superman gotta be the perfect face for this new DC universe, I had doubts but they’re all gone after watching the movie."
Lex Luthor created conflict in the middle east because he hated Superman.
"Two shots I wish weren’t in the trailers:

The boy raising the Superman flag

Lois and Big Blue’s kiss at the end

Those would have blown me away."
"As a slow reader with a tad bit of colour blindness... That initial info dump was a bit difficult to read thru 🤭🤭 

Total 9/10 tho... Loved Cena and especially Milly's cameo's... can't wait for thier upcoming projects... 

Now that's how you make a Supes movie 🫡🫡"
Loved it. It’s rare for a blockbuster to be so openly earnest. Its comparisons to a certain real life government were incredibly obvious but equally important. So glad it actually had something to say
"Nobody punched Guy Gardner in his highly punchable face. 

0/10"
"I want to be a better person, and because of Superman I realize I shouldn’t be scared to be one."
"I’m Irish, but am in the US this week so decided to check this out.

Man, American audiences are so much fun compared to back home 😂 the cheering at cameos, the applauding for the kiss at the end, the reactions to Krypto!


Had a blast. Loved the film. As a Nathan Fillion fan, I adored him in this and felt he stole every scene he was in. Supergirl bit was brilliant too; she absolutely nailed the introduction of the character with such little time.

Really loved the overall tone too and am super excited for the long term future of the universe."
"Rachel Brosnahan displayed more character and chemistry in that single interview scene than Amy Adams did in 3 full movies, 4 counting ZSJL. Not Amy’s fault entirely but the character was written terribly and had lukewarm chemistry at best with Henry."
"Yes! Edi Gathergi is also brilliant in the uneven but fantastic For All Mankind, too"
The fight scene reminded me of Yondu's ship breach in Guardians 2 more than 3's hallway fight scene. Even had the tech whizzing around like Yondu's whistle spear.
I love that he's basically just chilling in a recliner as he fights. Dude is all style.
"I’m familiar with Mr.Terrific from the arrowverse, and that version loses to green arrow. This new version of Mr.Terrific is a menace lol, he could decimate Team Arrow with how he kicked ass at the beach"
"Totally, I was worried he would be corny AF but they really knocked it out of the park! He really stole the show!

At face value he’s pretty ridiculous. His name, outfit, his name across his back, the big T on his face, floating around in his chair…such a silly design, but they just blow past all of that and show he’s a genius and a badass!"
"I just saw the movie and I’m not much of a DC buff outside of Batman but man Mr.Terrific is now my favourite!

Dude had the most badass line!

Luther Goons: “I’m giving you one more chance to back off!”

Mr.Terrific: “I was about to tell you the same thing”

*proceeds to fucking demolish everyone*"
"I loved the speech to Lois.. IM paraphrasing but something like

""Clark, it's a dog."" 

""Yeah, he's not even a good dog. But he's alone and he's probably scared."" 

I loved every second of that scene, especially with the fight in the background!"
"I remember the outrage when the clip went online earlier, they said it was out of character for Superman to barge in like that and scream too much.

Those people probably doesnt own a dog, lol."
"Nah. She didn’t murder him. Shopkeepers and adulterers get murdered. 

He was assassinated."
"Loved everything about this take on Hawkgirl. A character that's usually clowned on for being mid compared to the rest of the league, Gunn gave her PRESENCE.

The sheer aura of a berserk winged woman dive bombing at six hundred miles an hour, screeching at three hundred decibels and winding up a spiked mace was a wonder to behold in the theater. I'm a big fan now. 

edit - 

Apparently Manabu Yashiro, an up and coming manga artist behind Tank Chair, is a big fan too. 

[https://bsky.app/profile/yashiro-manabu.bsky.social/post/3ltz7xc54tk24](https://bsky.app/profile/yashiro-manabu.bsky.social/post/3ltz7xc54tk24)"
But it was Netanyahu so we can all cheer that.
"Nah, gravity killed him."
I dig her style
"I went in expecting Brosnahan to be my crush in the movie, but hawkgirl absolutely stole the crown for biggest baddie. That helmet! How did they achieve the perfect balance of sleek movie look and comic book-y?"
I saw a headline talking about a Jimmy Olsen series and now I just imagine it being the horniest show ever.
"There’s the scene in the beginning after Clark walks into the daily planet for the first time and sits down. There’s a cutaway to two women saying he’s so cute which I thought was about Clark, but I’m thinking they were referring to Jimmy."
I recognized him from something but had to look him up because I couldn't remember.  He's Gideon from The Righteous Gemstones!  That Gemstone money is pretty attractive.
"""it's more of a foster situation"" uuuhhhhh you're superman. He's a super dog. Who could you possibly be ""fostering"" him fo-


OOOHHHHH"
I love that she’s laughing at Crypto jumping at her her so hard she breaks floor. It’s such an amusing characterisation
Yessss! I loved that. 
"I loved the bit about “I didn’t try to kill you to start a war, I started a war so I could kill you!”

Paraphrasing cause I don’t know the actual quote."
LMFAOOOOO Lex was on Dennis time throughout the entire film
"He looks around, he's in the pocket universe with some guy he barely knows. Nothing but black holes and anti-proton rivers. He's like ""Ahh, there's nowhere for me to run, what am I gonna do, say no?"""
"NEWSFLASH ASSHOLE, I WAS TRYING TO KILL YOU THE *WHOLE TIME*"
"I loved the mini-twist of Lex admitting that he did not fight Superman to take over a country, he fabricated the entire conflict JUST TO FIGHT SUPERMAN!

And the #1 detail for me is that he spent YEARS designing the fighting-style to beat Superman but repeatedly punching him in the face was 1A. 1A. The first thing he thought of. 

Says so much about the character."
"The L.E.X. system:

Liaise with foreign dictators;
Excavate a rift in the earth;
eXterminate Superman"
 he nails lex.   He was menacing and a threat.   Knowing all Supermans moves before was a good call and I bet he has a kryptonite suit in the next movie
I loved the way he talked to people. So condescending. And when he's super pissed and he throws that cup off the desk twice. Hoult killed it.
That's when I knew he was probably Bizarro 🤣
And knocking the pencils on the floor AGAIN.
It wouldn’t have ended on a high note if not for that scene but I thought the same thing. The thing about this Superman movie is they wanted a happy ending instead of a grim and miserable real one where politicians start calling the daily planet “Fake news”.
"I enjoy how much weight the Daily Planet had in this film. They’re legit a third pillar of bringing the villains to justice.

We simply… don’t have that here."
I’m so glad someone caught this too! Seeing him kinda land awkwardly and yet still try to come off like it was no problem was so fucking funny. The “yeah I meant to do that” attitude was hilarious
"That ""monkeys furiously typing on keyboards"" scene is 100% gonna be one of the most used gifs for the next year"
#SuperShit
"And then using that social media activity as justification for what he does wants to do. And it works.

Which, ya know...pretty realistic."
"That was such perfect Lex Luthor pettiness, like *of course* he had that going on"
That scene was just absolutely laugh out loud. I love how this movie just went balls out and didn't give a shit.
It was the worst of times. It was the blurst of times.
"“Maybe next I’ll bring in that news reporter you’re so chummy with” 

*Oh shit, Lois is in danger*

“Yeah, let’s see how tough you are when I drag Clark Kent in here.”"
I loved him hitting the tanks with a bunch of giant green middle fingers
Laughed my ass off at that. So good.
There was a lot of eye torture in this movie. And I just had my eye polished.
"I think that part was such a subtle emotional part for me. 

Right after that saying “but, he is out there alone and probably is scared” 😭 Krypto shall never die in the DCU or I will lose it."
"Where’s the lie though? 

He just needs some training"
Calling him a foster when he has an owner and was just dog sitting.
"I loved that but it also brought into light how much I appreciated Gunn’s views on animals. If it wasn’t apparent from GotG Vol 3 then it definitely was in his GQ “Breaks Down” video where he goes into how much he loves animals. Then it was cemented in this movie. So many people are seen carrying their animals out of Metropolis on the evacuation. So many people are shown with their turtles, their dogs, their cats, it showed also how human Superman is in comparison: our innate love of our pets which are an extension of us even sometimes more."
"The ""he's not even that good of a dog"" was probably my favorite line in the movie."
"God I loved that his whole thing was just about destroying Superman. I *almost* thought they were going for yet another scheme where he wants a piece of land, but it was all just a plot to wreck Supes because he hates him so much."
Hater of the century
"My new favorite Lex, it was the comic book maniacal megalomaniac hater that I've been dying to see on the big screen since I started reading comic books. Perfect Lex"
I wonder if Nicholas Hoult had some blood pressure issues during filming.
"I like that Lex is self-aware here too, he recognizes that he's envious of him and everything."
"Side note but the Mali scene was insane, didn’t ever think they’d go there"
"Bruh was in his own narcissistic world. “Brain beats brawn” You’re using both, no way normal people can withstand supermans strength"
He was so petulant it was amazing.
Most satisfying villain takedown in almost any comic book movie for me. Getting outsmarted by Clark and then manhandled by Krypto showed how pathetic he really was.
"Seeing Lex cry without saying a word and getting a taste of his own medicine was satisfying yet cathartic: 

For a man who aspires to take down a being he considers an it than a man, he throws out his own humanity and that what ultimately brought his downfall. 

Superman believes in the goodness and capacity of kindness in humanity to do what is right. In spite of our flaws, not giving into those who treat us differently and look down on us."
He's the best live action Lex and it's not even close. Heck he's probably the first truly comic accurate Lex.
I can see this Lex getting Kryptonite poisoning and blaming Superman for it. Like dude no one forced you to spend time all your time around a radioactive rock
"Just got out of my showing and I’m still in awe of how petty he was in all this:

• Starts a genocide just to try and discredit Superman

• ID’s a guy just randomly helping Superman just to kidnap and kill him in front of Clark

• Repeatedly knocks over a cup to force his goons to be lower than him

• Hits Eve with a pencil *as she’s leaving*, then imprisons her for “cheating”

Like…. Jesus Christ"
He needed parents to look upto especially with the Bradley cooper twist. The ending had him relaxing peacefully watching his earth parents instead
the pa kent line about the responsibility of parents was genuinely just an amazing quote
"I saw people (mostly bad faith Snyder fans) complaining that the Kents were made into “low IQ rednecks” and I have to question if we watched the same movie because they’re literally just portrayed as wholesome loving parents who care about their son. If someone thinks that’s low IQ behavior, I feel sorry for whatever kind of relationship they had with their parents."
Krypto smashing her into the ground in the fortress had me laughing harder than I thought I would
"Calling her cousin, ""Bitch,"" on her way out. Yeah, I want to see her movie *now.*"
They have set up a very easy way to market her. 
"House of the Dragon Season 1 was enough to convince me of her talent, but yeah she’s got this in the bag."
Yeah I was not expecting her to be introduced the way she was but honestly it was done so well
I was shocked by how good she looked. She looks amazing
Krypto slamming her into the ground breaking shit while she was laughing was hilarious.
Yes some of my favourite parts.  Him flying on Krypto had me giggling 😂
I thought the same; felt like they needed to make sure the audience knew that wasn’t going to be a twist later. And that was best they could come up with.
"""Superman, I know these sound engineer guys, and they would *not* lie about this stuff.""

Like, sorry, what the hell was he talking about?

Like does Mr Terrific know every audio technician on the planet? And not *one* of them would take a generous bribe from Lex to lie?"
"It's basically lampshading to let you know, as an audience, it's not fake.

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging)"
I’m glad they did it because I was expecting a twist and that let me just accept it and move on
The scene where the Daily Planet crew were boarding Mr. Terrific's ship was straight out of a comic book panel to me lmao so many other scenes could be said about that too
I never blame Cavill. He did the job he was hired to do.
James Gunn and Sam Raimi the only 2 comic book movie directors to realize that moving the camera around is really fun
"And the citizens being used to it was explained in the first few seconds. Humanity has been dealing with this shit for 300 years. Makes sense that they would have a city wide evacuation plan just ready to go and everyone is casually like ""Earth ending disaster? No sweat. Let me grab my coat.""."
Poor Jimmy got a 10 but she’s a yapper.
"It was the best of times. 


It was the BLURST OF TIMES?!"
"The crowd in my theater was really engaged in the movie, but I felt like I was the only one laughing at the recurring gag of Jimmy being turned off by Eve. I get that she was intense/smothering but taking it a step further with Jimmy being confused by Lois calling her ""hot"" gave me Arrested Development (""Her?"") vibes with Ann."
"> I am sorry Jimmy i didn't know ~~youre~~ your game

Man was consistently being oogled by women throughout the movie. His first scene at the Daily Planet where the two at the cart waved at him, then the escorts on the street as he went to meet Eve."
“It was the blurst of times?!?!?!?”
I love that every time someone types “hashtag supershit” the font is huge due to Reddit formatting lol
"If anybody is to be thanked, it's the idiot Disney exec who fired him without consulting Kevin Feige and Bob Iger.

Who coincidently left and joined WB, before he himself could be fired."
You *know* the tweeting monkeys thing was him venting a little about that.
"superman to the monkeys: 

your rage bait worked. it worked. now im crying out of pure frustration. thanks"
Honestly the most realistic thing in this movie. Every time anyone reads something incredibly stupid or gets too engrossed in an online debate they should just remember this scene
"""It was the BLURST OF TIMES?!"""
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he gets his own spin-off series on HBO Max.
"Turns out the translation is “if you have game, clap as many cheeks as you like, just please use protection”"
Zodd warning?
"Speaking of which, there was a highway sign that said Gotham!"
"They literally had a scene of him saving a squirrel, then him not wanting to kill a kaiju. Quintessential Superman."
"I really want to see the ideologies of this hopeful Superman go against the dark and broody Batman. 

James Gunn is definitely going to make a World's Finest movie."
Rachel Brosnahan was the perfect casting
I was balling my eyes at the videos of him and his family at the end. Such an epic way to close out the film and leave us wanting more.
"Agreed, It looks and feels like a superman comic brought to life and that’s what I wanted from this movie and James Gunn delivered."
It's probably being set up for that clone to become some version of Bizarro.
"I thought Ultraman was an actual DC villain so I had absolutely no clue until the reveal.

Now, looking up [Ultraman](https://www.google.com/search?q=ultraman+dc&ie=UTF-8), it's super obvious since, not only is he a DC villain, he's an alternate-universe evil Superman. Duh haha"
Mister terrific was getting unfairly roasted by not putting the buildings together properly
"I don't need your help, I'm goddamn Mister Terrific!"
There’s so much shit in this movie that I completely forgot we see green lantern net up a giant floating space tentacle eyeball in the background
">The Justice Gang fights an Interdimensional Imp in the background of a conversation? Sure as shit they do.

I feel like that's an implied off-screen cameo by Mr. Mxyzptlk."
"For some reason I was expecting a slightly jokey, no stakes Lex Luthor, probably because of having recently watched BvS, but luckily that wasn’t the case, instead we got a petty ass cunt who had no qualms in killing somebody, even rage baiting Superman straight in his face, just sad we didn’t see Lex use his warsuit, but I’m totally fine with that getting another chance in the next movie, specially with how fucking pissed Luthor will come in."
"Superman was bright, colorful, somewhat complex and most importantly a boy scout *who just wants to save people with minimal damage*.

That is Superman to me and this movie absolutely nailed it the moment they had him save a squirrel.

I genuinely think this was about as good of a start to the new greater DC Comics movies going forward.

Also, Mr. Terrific was fucking *AWESOME* and I hope we see a whole lot more of him."
My biggest takeaway was that Nathan Fillion’s Green Lantern is the best version of the character they’ve ever done.
I loved how much of a dork Clark was. His stupid little dance with Jimmy at the beginning 🤣
"All I wanted was for Gunn to get Ma and Pa Kent right, and to have Superman stopping things from falling on people. 

It delivered."
"I think the film is a little clunky in the first two acts, a lot of good stuff and handful of things I didn’t care much for. 

But once they get to the farm, god damn. The third act of this movie absolutely rips, and to your point - it just nails Superman completely"
"People were worried Gunn would be too jokey.

I never had that fear. Watch Guardians 1-3, it's very clear he knows when humor is appropriate, and never lets it undercut the heart. There's the occasional ""random rock to Mantis' face"" moment, but it's never cynical or at the expense of the world or characters.

More than anything else, the Ratcatcher 2 flashback in The Suicide Squad sold me that he'd be a great fit."
"I think they addressed that, Ultraman doesn’t look exactly like Superman and isn’t able to speak/think freely. 

It would also take less than a few minutes for Superman to confront him and clear up that they’re two different people. It would be more problematic for Lex that the world knows about a clone than it would be worth trying that route."
the use of John Williams’ original theme in that moment when that electric guitar came in … chefs kiss
"Same, man. It's a shot used in all the trailers but something about it just hit different when watching the actual movie."
"You see a lot of kids wearing Superman, Batman, or Spider-Man in the hospital. These characters mean so much to kids in trouble and are pretty damn good role models"
"It was so well delivered! Like it could have been cringy cause of how corny it was, but it felt so sincere and rang so true!"
"You're not crazy. As soon as he took off that mask and I saw the hair, for one whole second, I thought they actually got Cavill."
"Hell, *people* turning on Lex at the end is barely realistic.

Oh, do we have solid evidence this racist billionaire is doing criminal shit, spreading lies and hate through massive media influence campaigns, and making dangerous power grabs to establish himself as a king? All that does in the real world is make their supporters double down and shout fake news.

Media like Superman loves to rely on this notion that the American public are often misguided but inherently good people that will do the right thing when push comes to shove. We value truth, justice, democracy, decency, and selflessness above any and *everything* else. The sort of feel-good thing you could say or even believe if you squinted.

Unfortunately, that gets harder and harder to sell every year, and especially this year. An America that sees through the con and rejects Lex Luthor is incompatible with reality, so much like Superman himself, the American public depicted in this movie is now a full-on aspirational myth too."
I love The Suicide Squad! More Bloodsport and Rat Catcher 2 please!
Thank God for cancel culture 🙏🏻
That usage of 30 years > 3 years > 3 weeks > 3 days > 3 hours > 3 minutes was perfect
"Loved it. It was very much like a comic book’s opening panels, just briefly setting the context and jumping into the story. I just hope the repeated use of 3 is a hint we get a real Trinity movie down the line."
"Excellent point. You can think of any number of 80s/90s sci-fi flicks that fail in using an opening narration or crawl to set the tone. This does it amazingly well. Here, Gunn skirts all the tedium while setting up the whole Kryptonian parentage thing for later in the movie for the two people who don't know the story and are somehow at a Superman movie."
The middle finger Green Lantern constructs were perfect
Best part of the movie by far. I knew the “you’re in” joke was coming but his face was so prefect
I think he’s in the upcoming Lanterns show but it will probably be a small role or cameo
"Right down to the part where they planned to steal half the land after the war is over, and turn it into the Luthor Riveria Resort and Casino."
"A think Boravia was more of a Russia with the whole ""liberating"" exvuse and Jarhanpur was Palestine. So both a nod to Ukraine and Gaza war."
"10,000%, I'm shocked he got away with making that allegory as transparent as it was. They never shied away from the vileness of it either. Good on Gunn"
"Rachel Brosnahan was born to play this role, I wish she had more screen time"
">Him shooting Mali definitely shocked me

Me too, this is a 12a movie, a prisoner getting executed right in front of Superman and then superman crying afterwards was genuinely shocking, did not think they would have the balls to go through with it.

Great job of highlighting Lex's cruelty but also the exact model human Superman is fighting for, Mali was great."
">The pure hatred Lex has shown in the movie, you could feel it

Hoult was absolutely the right guy to be casted as Luthor here. You can really feel the contempt oozing out of his being when he even has to spare one thought of Superman, and they made him go all out for it. I really love how no holds barred he was with Superman and I love the decision to outright emphasize his jealousy and envy towards meta-humans and how much of a disparity it comes into

A bit of a hot take on my end, but the movie manages to draw the line between Luthor's narcissism and his motivations well. This may be bad but I can almost visualise where the motivation behind Luthor's speech to Superman is coming from, but the movie also makes it very clear that his ideologies are fucked up and his ultimate goal is for his own benefit, instead of the benefit of the people. I am not surprised some people bought into the cause, and I really love how his own narcissism was his own downfall. It is so, *so* good"
Milly was on screen for 15 seconds and I already know she’s the perfect Supergirl.
"Underrated comment. Exactly how I felt and to me it shows they got his character and values right. Him saving the squirrel was a small action but tells you everything. The movie itself was good, not outstanding or made me feel the kind of highs or emotions of some Marvel movies (like GOTG). I liked/loved all the characters and I don't think any of the actors put a foot wrong. Everyone was great and aside from Superman and Lois the other standouts were Mr Terrific and Guy Gardner followed by Lex. Lex felt like a grown up, bitter version from the one portrayed in Smallville.


That last scene felt like pure GOTG. Emotional to a point but a bit flat. But as a first entry in the new universe it's solid and sets things up pretty nicely in terms of it's characters. 


Edit: grammar"
"Love this comment, taking advantage of being here to see a big movie opening night with a new audience."
That was Edi? Holy crap! I didn’t even put 2 and 2 together. He’s awesome in For All Mankind and now in Superman.
The camerawork reminded me more of the gotg3 hallway fight but the actual fight itself reminded me more of yondu one
"I knew 0 about the character going in but loved every minute he was on screen. The sheer straight-talking, get-it-done confidence. Terrific indeed."
"I think that is what James Gunn excels at with comic book adaptations. Guardians of the Galaxy and The Suicide Squad both double down on the weirdness, and end up being some of the most fun (despite some flaws) superhero movies, but also the most heartfelt.


Gunn doesn't try to make more realistic costumes, or rebrand the names into something more marketable, or go too in-depth on how powers work, or how characters exist.


Mister Terrific has a T-mask, T-spheres, a T-ship, and is really irked by someone calling a sphere a circle."
I’m seeing this tonight with my wife and this is guaranteed to make my wife cry. The scared and alone thing she has said about our own dog many many times when we leave her home for a couple hours lol
"And then we see him captured, but having the time of his life chasing squirrels lol."
"“You have a dog?”

“It’s more of a “foster” type situation”"
"Agreed. 

Gunn gets the character"
">  But he's alone and he's probably scared.

Am I the only one that interpreted that as him talking about himself while talking about the dog? And then >!she gives him a big hug, showing him he's not alone!<."
Those people actually want Superman to be the boring caricature his haters claim he is.
"“Illusion, Michael. A trick is something a whore does for money.”"
I fucking loved that she had a hawk war scream. No idea if it's comic accurate but it makes her more than just Yet Another Metahuman but with a hawk aesthetic.
“I’m not Superman.” Says so much about other heroes vs Superman.
"If the spinoffs are going to be like Peacemaker or The Penguin, make as many as you want."
They 100% were referring to Jimmy.
"For any fellow Psych fans, he was also young Shawn."
"He's in Santa Clarita Diet too!

ETA. Nathan Fillion was also in SCD! I knew he looked familiar."
"Yeah that was a great show, he’s just smashing the floor with the back of her head and she’s like aww baby"
Next you'll tell me that Lex ran a fake presidential campaign just to piss Superman off
One of the best motivations I've seen. Just a pure hater through and through.
"> Lex was on Dennis time

Lex is asshole. Why Superman hate?  
Because Lex is a bastard man!!"
This thread is making me realize how shockingly aligned Lex and Dennis are.
Are these superheroes in danger?
It's the implication
The looks of disdain and hatred he has towards superman. He nails the role completely
"That cup thing was the most petty bullshit and I absolutely loved it. I knew he'd kill it, but man, he exceeded my expectations. Easily the best live action Luthor in my books."
"""PICK THAT UP!""

{Fawning yes-men immediately scramble to pick it up.}

Also, when he knocks it over again immediately after they're done and they scramble to pick it up again without being told this time."
it does feel like Bizarro setup!
“I’m only doing it to piss off Green lantern” 😂
Hashtag Supershit
You know that one bothers him the most
In fact the ending of the movie is more unrealistic than the premise. The billionare got arrested because his actions were made public?
"The whole pocket dimension and the prison of pettiness, was so egomaniacal mad scientist. Very Silver Age."
The guy was locking up his ex girlfriends in inter-dimensional prisons for crying out loud.
I loved that his stated reason for turning himself in to the authorities was to find the dog.
That and the squirrel were such great scenes that really showed how much James Gunn gets it
"""...and probably is scared"" was just so perfectly delivered by David. Superman doesn't want anyone to feel scared and alone."
Yeah she ain't doing it lol
To be fair it didn’t seem like he had any idea when she’d show back up lol
"I loved that too, ironically it was when I actually started to really respect Lex

No real big plans, no techno messiah, just sheer unadulterated jealousy and pettiness. Cant wait to see him become president of the united states lol"
It probably balanced out his low blood pressure from Nosferatu
"Same, I never got the Lex fanboys who say there's merit to his feud with Superman and he's doing it for humanity. 

There's a whole wide universe out there and antagonizing one of the few aliens who is going out of his way to help humanity is shortsighted and signs of obvious jealousy."
"Caught me off guard for sure. But really good to see a Russian roulette scene subverted that way. Also, it took the choice of saving Mali or saving his parents out of Superman's hands."
The guy that played Mali was incredible in that scene. I'm happy Mali got recongized at the end.
I knew the minute they scanned his face he was screwed.
Even Lex was surprised.
"Mali was such a hero in it too. Dude has his life on the line and he’s still telling Superman to give Lex nothing. I love that his death affected Superman so much *and* that it inspired Metamorpho to action.

I like that Lex fucked up the interrogation too. He got rid of his leverage way too quickly. Luthor is smart but he also has his blind spots."
I didn’t think they’d go there either but I’m glad they did. DC ain’t afraid of a little darkness
"The fact that Superman sheds a tear for this seemingly random person who he's only met twice as far as we know, in his 3 years of doing superhero work, is one of the reasons I love this iteration of superman"
"I did like that despite that he’s still smart, he was never depicted as a dumbass. His hubris and hate were what got him in the end but Lex was never portrayed as an idiot."
Loved the line where Superman was like “You’re just envious” and Lex just responds basically like “yeah no shit I’m not dumb”
Hater of the century
He really got “Hulk smash’d” by a dog
I thought his mum was Lady Gaga at first. Turns out wrong.
That ending made me tear up sooo bad i was afraid the light were gonna turn on anytime during the credits lmao
Someone mentioned it but now I'm hoping braniac is to blame for the corrupted file and he's up next
"I feel like a lot of people now view it as weakness to just be a good, wholesome person that's not conflicted"
"The ""lowest IQ"" thing they do is Martha yelling into the phone sitting on the table, which honestly is just such an old woman thing to do that it isn't a knock on her intelligence at all"
It explains so much why krypto acts that way around supes. He was never trained properly and she just lets him loose without knowing his own strength. It's a nice little touch that explains a bit on both their counts
"I just wish Clark and Kara interacted more. I’m pretty sure the actors weren’t even in the same room when filming.

I’m a sucker for good sibling or cousin friendships. I hope the next films show them together just hanging out with Clark looking out for Kara even though she can handle herself. "
"That alone was enough to get me 110% excited for her movie, can’t wait to see her and Lobo interact!"
I think Clark may have done Lex a favor by saving Krypto. I'm not sure he would want to deal with drunk supergirl pissed at him for stealing her dog. 
I was cracking at the way she was laughing as Kypto is just slamming her into the ground.
Gary judging her was fucking hilarious.
"""If I had emotions I would seriously be concerned for her"""
Apparently her movie has some crazy talent behind it that immediately got it greenlit
They need in-character Supergirl social media accounts that just post drunk selfies of her on weird alien planets.
Milly is so cute and has the perfect look of a drunk party girl superhero.
"The ""Where's my seat?!"" line killed me LOL"
The way all the citizens are so blasé with super fights going on all around them.
I really liked the scene where Lois is in Mr. Terrific’s safety bubble and the camera is spinning around like crazy as we watch him beating everyone up from her chaotic point of view. 
"She's got mutant toes dude, Jimmy is suffering 😔"
"I love how confused he was when Lois called her his hot girlfriend. 

Cause, shrimp cocktail ruined her for him."
Real talk tho... he smiled at the end. Is there a chance in the sequel Jimmy stops his womanizing ways and settles down with eve?
Dude cucked Lex Luthor
"It looked like he was coming around to her at the end. It was cute.

But yeah, no idea what all these women saw in him. I guess he was just looking for flaws to get out of it. I was hoping we would see her ""unconventional"" toes at some point to see if it was justified."
You stupid monkey!
"#\#SUPERSHIT

"Am out of the loop, ..what?"
#supershit
"I saw that! I wonder how close the 2 cities are.

I think sometimes in the comics they place Gotham City in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delware and I both like that and find it goofy at the same time."
"*Leonardo DiCaprio point* 

When I saw the Gotham City sign"
There's honestly no one who felt out of place. Casting was great.
"Yeah she was so fantastic. Really felt the chemistry between her and David. 
As much as I love Amy Adams her relationship with Superman never really fit"
She’s also so fucking gorgeous.
"I loved her allegiance to journalistic integrity.  And that her integrity wasn’t an option, even when Superman was frustrated that she couldn’t just be his girlfriend and “know” who the bad guys were.  

Lois Lane’s journalistic integrity is only matched by Superman’s guileless idealism.  Rock meet other rock.  

I miss when journalists were seen as heroes.  I hope those days will return some day."
The kid raising the flag with the symbol and the classic Superman theme playing is what got me.
"The final scene is them showing you that it was the nurturing of Jonathan and Martha Kent that lead Clark to wanting to be a better person and become a symbol of hope even though it was in his nature to do the opposite 

His greatest strength is his willpower and this movie shows that better than any Superman movie that has come before this one"
"Yes! I totally expected them to show the first half of the clip again. When it was his human parents, I whispered “oh my god” then teared up hard.  It was beautiful. 

The scene with his dad talking to him and the kid putting up the Superman flag also got me."
"I thought it already was, just wasn't named."
"Golly, Superman really can be a jerk sometimes."
I feel like that was teasing that the inter-universal rift wasn't perfectly sealed
I loved how there was one part where you can make out Guy swinging a giant green bat around.
The construct middle fingers had me ROLLING
There’s Imps beside Mxy- it’s not his MO to turn into a squid and destroy stuff. Might have been Vyndtyx
Mxyzptlk is such a weirdo it's odd he wasnt here for a Gunn movie. Even in the after credits or something.
"> use his warsuit, but I’m totally fine with that getting another chance in the next movie

Luthor will 100% learn the wrong lesson from his defeat. He’ll determine that it was because he relied on other people to do the fighting for him. "
"This is, without a doubt, the coolest Mr Terrific has ever been. I just hope the actor does a little less ""badass"" voice moving forward."
Mr Terrific is basically never featured in a ton of stuff so it was good to see him. The sphere-takedown scenes were right out of Guardians 1 & 2 with the arrow.
"He was the standout honestly, but the whole Justice Gang turned out to be great. Gunn just knows how to do media about a gang of endearingly stupid misfits."
"His Guy was perfect. Beautiful bowl cut, it even had failed layering. Exquisite. 


But, man, maybe it's my local theater audio system being jank. All I heard was Woody Harrelson when Fillion was talking. Like Woody dubbed the lines in. I need to rematch this movie in a better theater and see if it was just bad speakers, or if Nathan was doing a voice he thought fit the character."
"I love how he always says things like ""gosh darn"" instead of actually cursing. 

And saving a squirrel in the middle of a kaiju fight!"
Everytime he was trying to eliminate the casualties and focus the fighting up in the sky when that thing was breathing out fire. Finally a superman that tries to keep the fighting away from regular people
Pa Kent was so sweet in this movie. They really nailed the awkward sentimental dad vibe.
"Definitely helped by David delivering it angry/fed up. Had he done a cliche hero voice, it would’ve come off as corny. But he was fed up with Lex’s bullshit and finally got the chance to speak his mind to him, and he delivered that like he’d been waiting years to say it. 

Beautiful ending for them."
"I think the way he sorta stumbled through his speech adds to it, and to his whole thing of being human"
"To be fair, superhero movies are usually wish-fullfilment power fantasies"
Don’t forget 300 years! I loved that they established that metahumans were known for that long rather than trying to square away in the future about random metahumans showing up that had long histories without being known by anybody.
And then we get told that Clark and Lois have been seeing each other for 3 months.
So good. Can't wait to see him in Peacemaker and Lanterns
It sounds pretty big actually. Nathan is saying he’s dropped more f-bombs in it than his entire career combined.
I fucking love how Luthor is still basically just a real estate huckster
Yeah I also got Russia/Ukraine vibes. The Boravia president even gave some bullshit excuse about freeing Jarhanpur from oppressive leaders just like Putin said about freeing Ukraine from Nazis
It explains so much why krypto just attacks superman without reg6ards for boundaries or it's strength. Krypto's just ragdolling Supergirl and she's just laughing through it hahah
"I'm complete comic book nerd, and Mister Terrific is one of my favorite DC characters.

This version is exceptionally faithful to the comic book version, but turned up to 11. It took everything awesome about Mister Terrific and made it *more so*."
"Smarter than Batman, humble enough to lie about it, not so humble as to not call himself Mr. Terrific."
"I dunno, it felt very Clockwork Orange to me."
Super Squirrels!
"I also loved how no one said ""you have a hawk war scream haha what's up with that?""  They just let this funny/scary character trait stand on its own without the need to point it out."
"Damn, that's an interesting...question."
"Yeah, I think that's what made this version of Lex so amazing compared to iterations such as the Snyder-verse. Lex was just crazy, nihilistic, nut in the Snyder-verse. He was the Joker with more money. And his core motivation? He wanted to kill Superman or something? Meanwhile, the core motivation of Lex is literally as simple as jealousy. In a world without Metahumans and Superman, Lex is going to be the most talked-about person on the planet. And he's driven insane by someone born with abilities that far exceed his own and it sent him on a path to try and tear him into nothingness."
"Dude was auditioning for superman, polar opposite role so it’s great he knows how wide his acting range is"
"Just so much better than the Jesse Heisenberg dipshit iteration (which I do mostly blame on Snyder). Hoult was just perfectly smug, obsessive and a massive dickhead. Having a team of believable sycophants licking his ass throughout the movie added to the character a ton."
I don't even think it's setup. The character was literally just Bizarro. They just didn't call him that
"It was such a small thing, but it really made him so human for that lmao"
I imagine the Kents taught him to dislike profanity lol
The sincerity of Corenswet’s delivery of that line makes it so damn funny lol 
"Yeah, seemed a little too fanciful there."
"To be fair, they completely skipped the whole justice system. He didn't have time to get a million dollar attorney, or bribe a judge or anything."
"Krypto is normally portrayed as a pretty disciplined dog with high intelligence.

This version is just pure chaos. I’d love a mix"
I don't think she did either.
"No competent writer is ever going to use Lex Luthor to genuinely criticize Superman.  Because the whole point of Lex Luthor is that he's the richest, smartest man in the world.  There is basically nothing he couldn't do if he set his mind to it.  The fact that he's so obsessed with Superman instead of fixing the world's problems always low key reveals that no matter what he says, he doesn't actually care about making the world a better place.

That doesn't mean that there aren't genuine criticisms to be made of Superman.  It also doesn't mean that Lex Luthor can't say things that *seem* like valid criticisms -He is, in most incarnations, extremely intelligent and usually pretty charismatic.  He's a businessman and politician, he knows how to choose his words carefully and say things that people will agree with while masking his true intentions.  

But, ultimately, Lex is the absolute worst person to be criticizing Superman and any argument that comes out of his mouth is undermined by having him be the one to say it.  If the writer has something genuine to say about Superman that they want the audience to listen to, they're going to have someone like Lois or another superhero say it, not Lex Luthor."
Kiss kiss bang bang has one thats one of my favorites
"Absolutely, Mali gets like one minute of screen time in the whole movie but I really believed he was the crucial pivot that made Superman even more determined to escape. Those impassioned shouts in his final seconds really got to me."
that quick moment felt more eerie than I thought it would have been
"He didnt get rid of his leverage. That was the scariest part of the scene for me. How many people did Lex scan who were even SLIGHTLY friendly to Superman? If giving him a simple meal is enough for Lex to consider him a pawn for leverage against Superman, then imagine how many people he would've revolved through to get what he wants out of Superman? No way Lex didn't have 100s of potential innocents on a list to snuff through, all to torment Supes for information."
And the way it immediately affected Element Man.
"Lex was legitimately dangerous in this movie. Right off the bat, he's already cloning Superman, making pocket universes, a whole fleet of Lexcorp armored goons, fusing people with nanites, genetically engineering kaiju, etc. 

He's *miles* ahead of every other depiction of Lex I can think of. In the comics, he's one of the smartest men on Earth and effectively a techno wizard, but most adaptations are afraid of depicting him as *this* capable. The DCAU, Young Justice, and the recent My Adventures with Superman are the only ones that come close, but even they fall short of this kind of casual Mr Fantastic-tier science-scorcery.

We've come a long, long way from Gene Hackman with nothing more than a wig and 2 comically inept assistants to get shit done."
I think he was even smirking being taken away. He’s got more to give and I’m ALL for it from Hoult.
His speech about how all of this was an excuse to kill Superman would make Reverse Flash jealous
I liked that Superman was kinda half-heartedly trying to stop it and kinda enjoying it.
Angela Sarafyan! Who is *so* fine.
Superman - A Son is Born
"I’m very interested in Supergirl’s attitude towards people as she grew up around Kryptonians.

I can only wonder if Braniac did doctor the file as she obviously isn’t trying to take over the world and Clark didn’t seem suspicious.

Guess I’ve got to wait for her movie!"
She’s definitely the girl that adopted a puppy and didn’t listen to the attachment training at all
"What’s cool is that it’s clear Krypto is still very aware of his strength and how he can easily hurt others, but still controls himself. If he didn’t know how strong he was, he woulda accidentally ripped that baby’s head off instead of simply licking it. Krypto is very intelligent, it’s just his current owner is an early to mid- 20s party girl who neglects him and Clark doesn’t want to train him since it’s not his pet (yet). So he acts out, but only on stuff he knows can take it."
"It's probably a side effect of her being cast late (primarily for Supergirl) and flown out for one day of filming in the studio. 

I hope that Superman appears in the Supergirl movie. Similar to this, giving him a proper scene with Supergirl at the end to talk about the events of the movie would be great. The comic it's based on gets *heavy*."
You know they are both going to get massively drunk together.
Explains why Krypto is like that 🤣
I was hoping they would show the feet to show us why Jimmy called them mutant lol
I love how absolutely confused Lois is at how many hot women he pulls lol
I love/hate that description. It's almost too graphic.
"Nah, The Silver Bansheesis his one, true love."
"Possibly.  Lois calls her hot not long before that and he's like ""Hot??"" all confused, like he never thought of her that way before."
"James Gunn used to work for a very edgy/raunchy studio, and his humor reflected the same. He used to make very inappropriate/offensive tweets in the name of shock/dark humor.

Many years later, sometime after GotG 2 and now working with Disney, he was very vocal against Trump and some right-wing people on Twitter dug up those tweets, and people started blasting them.

It became so big online in such a short time and ended up on news networks like Fox, so Walt Disney Studios chair Alan Horn stepped above Marvel Studios chair Kevin Feige to fire James Gunn. Apparently, Feige wasn't happy.

Gunn was reinstated within a year to finish GotG 3. However, in the months he was fired, he was hired by Warner Bros to work on The Suicide Squad, and was eventually offered to head their DC Studios. He finished The Suicide Squad, did GotG 3, and is now in charge of DC the way Feige is in charge of Marvel Studios.

Within the 2-3 years of firing Gunn, Horn retired from Disney and now works at Warner Bros Discovery too, as a consultant."
"Gunn had some old tweets that were obviously jokes but in very poor taste.

One said something along the lines of: I like it when little boys touch me in my no-no place. And there was another about him having been raped.

There was massive blowback and he was fired by Disney sometime after Guardians 2. DC picked him up and he went back to do Guardians 3 but at that point he was already selected to run the show at DC."
"Lois' car had a Delaware license plate, and in The Penguin, a character's driver's license places Gotham in NJ. (I realize they're not a shared universe.)"
"No one was out of place, but there was so many great characters you wished some got more screentime (especially my girl Shayera)"
I was really skeptical on Hoult but he won me over by how legit dastardly and flat out evil he portrayed Lex. I haven't hated a villain in a movie where I wanted to see him get an comeuppance since the Higher Evolutionary in GotG3.
"The most perfectly cast Jimmy Olsen. Who, surprisingly, is just drowning in 😻."
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel-heads just keep raking in Ws
Woman literally looks like she stepped out of a [comic.](https://i0.wp.com/www.bulletproofaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lois-Lane.jpg?fit=563%2C422&ssl=1)
"It worked well because they were both coming from the right place.


As a journalist Lois needs to view things in areas of grey in order to get to the hard hitting questions. The questions people don't want to be asked. And it's not personal, it's just journalistic integrity and holding herself to a standard.


And for Clark the answers are simply black and white. Innocent people were going to die and he was in an opportunity to save them. It couldn't be more simple.


That clash played off so well but you can see the love they have for each other because of it. Lois can challenge Clark in a way no other person can and even though it can bother him I think he's drawn to that. And when Lois asks these hard hitting questions and Clark can't see the situation outside of ""I had to save people"" it validates why Lois fell in love with him. He couldn't have given a better answer even if it's her job to challenge it.


They were both written so well and had such great chemistry."
Only to have Guy Gardner swoop in and start bursting giant green middle fingers out of the ground hahaha
"If you want to get technical, the onscreen Ultraman is an amalgamation of the comic book versions of Bizarro and Ultraman.

I’m guessing they figured it’s best to make one clone story rather than potentially rehash the same clone story twice if they ever decide to do a bizarro story.

Hence why Ultraman went into the black whole with his fate on standby. Wouldn’t doubt it if the black hole somehow took him to Bizarro world. "
Giant middle finger constructs was peak assholery for me.
The oven mitts on the Kaiju lmao
"In a movie already so densely packed with villains and henchmen, throwing in such a big character, even for just a single scene, probably would have been too much. I could see Mr. Mxyzptlk making a proper appearance in a future film not focused on Superman's rivalry with Lex Luthor."
"Totally agree. Edi Gathegi is a really compelling Mr. Terrific. He just gets the character and makes him feel smart without being overly serious, even despite his overly badass voice at times. 

I also liked the scene where he uses a force field to protect Lois Lane while he’s out there taking down the bad guys and the music starts playing during the fight, which is such a James Gunn thing to do."
"I hope he does it more, I loved it"
I'm just happy to see Edi Gathegi get a good turn. They did him dirty in X-Men.
"Personally, I love that about the character. His 'badass' voice just feels so saturday morning cartoon in a great way."
I go the impression it was the *character* wanting to sound “badass”.  Didn’t his voice completely change when he was shocked by the rift? Just for a moment he dropped the faux Christian Bale Batman voice and sounded normal.
"“Justice Gang, that’s a cool name.”

“…You’re in.”"
"Honestly hard to pick for me. 

Between Supes, Lex, Mr. Terrific, Guy, Lois, Jimmy the Rizz master and Krypto it’s hard so many great characters.

>!And what they teased of Kara has me pumped for Supergirl!<"
"I got a kick out of him bonking the eyeball monster with a bat in the background, almost lazily."
">Beautiful bowl cut

347 more women to find"
Definitely sounded like classic Fillion to me!  Hopefully it was just your theatre.
"The fact that the ""#SuperShit"" hashtag in particular pisses him off makes so much sense."
"""Krypto! What the hey, dude?"""
I loved the Kaiju fight where you can see how the other superheroes are all excited about fighting a giant monster and Superman is 100% focused on just trying to keep people safe and getting frustrated by all the collateral damage the others are causing. It was such a cool juxtaposition that really emphasizes what makes Superman unique.
Ma Kent on the speaker phone call was hilarious.
It's gonna hurt real bad if they adapt his death in a future movie.
"What I loved about that 'twist' (about Clark's actual birth parents) is how it painted the Kents in comparison. They were so normal, and down to earth.

Pa Kent's 'aw shucks, it ain't fer parents to tell their kids how to be, it's to give 'em the tools to decide who they want to be' was a perfect contrast/counter to to the Haughty Space Parents trying to force their son's destiny."
"Someone once described the Superman power fantasy to me as ""what if absolute power didn't corrupt, but was wielded by absolute good."" So, yeah, this reads."
Otisburg?
Ditzy valley girl raver Kara is not something I expected but makes me excited for Supergirl.
"I honestly loved that krypto wasn't a perfectly trained dog.

""I was worried he'd kill my parents cows."""
And then just calling Superman a bitch on the way out haha. I cant wait for her movie.
It was definitely intended to be. But Krypto has so much energy that he was having fun.
"""What is she, some kind of hawk woman?"""
"Can't blame Jessie Eisenberg for that. Every character felt off in those movies. Luthor felt more like The Riddler, Batman felt more like Lex, Superman felt more like Dr Manhattan.  

This movie is pretty good but I love that Superman, Lex, Lois, etc."
This movie lowkey introduced so many characters(justice gang) and still managed to give a coherent story unlike BVS.
"i feel like that black hole is going to bake him into a fully cooked, sign necklace, Bizarro."
"Well, Lex said that cloning Superman was the easy part, so he may make one again."
*ugly dog with a cape?*
Clark prefers words such as “golly” and phrases like “darn it”
I give this a pass only because he quite literally tore Metropolis in half
It takes nearly destroying for a billionaire to go to prison.
pretty sure he was just detained and took to prison awaiting trial. He wasn't immediately convicted.
"To quote All-Star Superman:

> You could have saved the world years ago if it had mattered to you luthor

Which is funny, because I absolutely see this lex giving the same response that he had in the movie adaptation:

> I know.

Though it would be more out of spite in this case."
"""Eight percent? Who taught you math?!"""
"His anguished wail after Mali's end. Just one of those moments that really sold that he's a guy who wants to save anyone he possibly can, and not being able to do so tears him apart."
"It's how fucking petty Lex is, and how very fucking real that pettiness is. Guy helps superman, gives him sharwarma once, and instantly he gets put on a shitlist, disappeared into a government sanctioned black site."
>!An entire room of incredibly dedicated goons and an esports team just so he live out his fantasy of beating up Superman himself.!<
"Speaking of Hackman, I did enjoy the swerve at the end where it seemed like Luthor was trying to kill Superman as part of another land acquisition plot, but then it’s revealed that it was actually the other way around: seizing the land gave him an excuse to kill Superman."
"His whole operation and ability to predict actions made him so much more capable. And I like that Gunn didn't resort to constantly having him explain his operation, he just showed us. Not treating us like we're stupid or haven't been watching tons of superhero stuff for almost 20 years now between the MCU and DC."
“He copied my whole fuckin flow! Word for word! Bar for bar!” - Thawne
"I loved that subversion. Immediately went ""That's the Lex I know and hate"". Because of course Lex would start a war between two countries, open a dimensional rift that could annihalate the planet, and have an entire farm full of robot monkeys typing hate shit about Superman just to try and kill Superman."
Most satisfied he was with Krypto the entire movie.
I was doing the Di-Caprio finger pointing meme to my wife saying Clementine!
"My immediate thought is that they're very much Ancient Greeks - debauched, classist, but not necessarily *evil* per se, just have very different cultural norms.

""Kal-El, we are sending you to be a god amongst men on Earth. Be a good man! Grow strong! Have many wives and many children! Show them your might and be a good king to them!""

Which is honestly as opposed to the 'typical' Kryptonian character which is Kara, just getting blitzed and doing debauchery when they should've been fixing their planet before it was destroyed. Krypto, too, is the 'ideal' Kryptonian dog just getting up to destructive hijinks."
You think Krypto can smell the kryptonian in people?
Only if Tarantino was the director
"It would be hilarious if her toes were perfectly normal, but Jimmy gets so many women that he subconsciously finds ""flaws"" in all of them to justify his lack of commitment."
"The firing happened while Bob Iger was on vacation, IIRC"
"The even goofier and more convoluted part of this as that the tweets being dug up up was in retaliationtion to Disney/ABC Roseanne Barr from her own show for a tweet comparing a black Congresswoman to Zira from Planet of the Apes.  Conservatives on Twitter said ""Oh but what about these tweets, huh?"" 

Barr stayed fired from her own show, which was retireld to just the Connors and continued on for several season, meanwhile Gunn still got to eventually make Guardians 3 while also launching a whole other phase of his career at DC."
Half her screen time just being her yelling was funny but also unfortunate. I know she’ll have at least a scene in Peacemaker but it’s a shame we don’t really know where else she might pop up. Guess we gotta wait and see what happens. Least someone like Guy will get a chance to be in that Lanterns show so we got him coming back already confirmed.
"The casting of Jimmy Olson was so good I could swear that guy had been Jimmy before, but nope, doesn’t look like it."
"I feel like Gunn has a knack for truly despisable villains at this point. High Evolutionary, Lex Luthor, to an extent Ego, like damn."
The dead link makes this post so funny
This movie was a better Green Lantern movie that Green Lantern movie with Ryan Reynolds lmao
The constant bonking from his spheres in that scene was so satisfying too. Kudos to the sound designers for that.
"""You brought that dog, man"" was perfect"
"Yeah I loved him forcing the badass voice as part of his edgelord persona, but then we see his badass ego cracking when Krypto starts chasing his spheres lol"
"Yeah, I think it was a good choice by the actor because it's like Terrific is just really, *really* trying. Like he's sensitive about being taken seriously and how people perceive him. Like when >!post-credits, Superman saying that the city got put back together just a little bit off and Terrific just takes it so, so very personally. The poor man.!<"
"""Sorry, kid. Superman couldn't make it, so you got an upgrade."" is such a Guy Gardner line."
Guy Gardner: Jerk With a Heart of Gold
"Trainwreck party girl Supergirl is a surprise, but I'm interested in seeing where that takes her.

At least it makes her different from her cousin in a way that's not just ""Superman, but girl."""
"Hawkgirl my beloved, don’t forget her."
Then when you see the monkey bot farm and hes so upset about it. so good.
"Of all things to tick him off, it was that #SuperShit comment. That part had me dying. Honestly, it's refreshing to see a Superman who's such a dork for once."
"I haven't heard ""What the hey"" since like 1990."
"I loved this especially because aside from the fact that the line/moment was so funny, it implies that even ""heck"" is too crass for him"
He saves the squirrel! I loved it
Not to mention the fact that he didn’t want to kill the Kaiju and was looking for a way to safely transport it out of the city.
"Shoot Superman's first thought was about how to peacefully capture the creature instead of just killing it. 

I thought that was a great detail."
I also love that they share a phone. You know Pa ain’t got the time for that technology.
"I'm a big ""power doesn't corrupt, power merely reveals"" person. There's been plenty of people in history that have received incredible levels of power and refused to be corrupted by it, after all, but so many of the most abusive assholes in history have shown their corrupt natures when granted even the most miniscule pieces of power.

Its just sad that, so often, those that ***seek*** power are those that want to misuse it, because of those things that they want that they can't get without that power..."
Drunk alien party montage is gonna hit so good
"“You got a green lantern and now a hawk too, huh?"
"Nathan fillion was absolutely fantastic as Guy. The introductions of characters were done elegantly to set up future productions. Supergirl, even being only there for 30 seconds, made me excited for her movie. I love the brooding teenage lack of discipline and zero responsibilities she gave off."
They aren't keeping the name
That's why everything in the pocket dimension was made of cubes. It's Bizzaro World.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?! 😡
"> ""KRYPTO! What the hey, dude??""

No saying god, damn, or hell, and really hates ""#SuperShit"", that's the big blue boy scout right there."
I adored that he wanted to go right back in and save everyone imprisoned there
Peter Thiel is salivating somewhere.
"Lex's team deserves a mention. A lot of times, besides the relevant right arm and a few others, the closest goons to a villain are depicted as either just amoral, or even almost victims (""I didn't realize he could go that far!"").

Not them. They are of course huge sycophants and asskissers - I bet there were some predecessors imprisoned in the pocket universe because Lex didn't want to feel outsmarted by them - but they are clearly into what they do, not caring about the damage they cause unless it affects them personally.

There's a small moment where, while Krypto is destroying the drones used to control Ultraman, one gets angry because another reports the destruction of a drone before himself. So petty, so narcissistic. No wonder these people are part of Lex's personal team.

The one with the 70s pornstache gets a small speck of conscience as that dimensional tear was too much for him but he enabled everything else beforehand, even with a stupid smile on his face. It was satisfying to see Terrific shove him out."
"She's known in our household as Westworld Plague Rat.  With the upmost respect of course, she's a baller."
"I’m going to give it space for the sequel. 
Misinformation was a theme throughout the film so that thread being picked up in a sequel wouldn’t surprise me."
"Probably. I believe he’s also just smart enough to be able to deduce if someone is more durable than normal. Like if Wonder Woman ever came around, I’m sure he’d know that he can be a little rougher with her and that it wouldn’t hurt her like it would a human."
"Ah yes, the Seinfeld classic"
"Because, unlike Barr, the people that Gunn worked with 100% adored him and refused to work without him. Nobody was willing to go to bat for Roseanne. That tells you a lot about her."
"I'm glad they gave him that scene instead of Guy or Hawk Girl. It shows that Terrific isn't just the smart guy in the chair, he's a capable fighter."
very much calling back to Yondu's whistle dagger scenes from Guardians.
I’m goddamn Mr. Terrific!
"Poor kid though. He’s praying his heart out for Superman, and Guy fucking Gardner with his yee yee ass haircut shows up 😂"
"Abrasive, arrogant dickhead who is still a good person at his core is exactly what Guy Gardner needed to be. He’s not my favorite Green Lantern, but I love when he’s in an ensemble."
"Read the comic it’s based on. It’s really good, dark isn’t the right word for it, but more adult than you’d expect"
The way she just came in and cursed at her cousin and Clark mentioning how she likes to go to Red Sun planets to get drunk reminded me of [Bitch Puddin's introduction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Y3lwCr66Q)
Ah true. Her scene with the Baravian President was cool.
I personally loved that Hawkgirl was Latina cause it gave me big Justice League Unlimited vibes
"That was such a Silver Age comic book moment and I loved it. Made no sense: computer bots are way faster and more efficient but that wouldn't be evil *in style*, now would it?"
What other director would have had the chutzpuh to give us a monkey bot farm?
I half expected the squirrel to run back at the monster lolol
That was great. I was wondering why Superman was seemingly struggling to fight some no name monster. The reveal he was trying not to hurt it so it could get rehomed in an intergalactic zoo was brilliant.
"And they still call TV, ""The Box.""  lmao, loved it."
I hope she parties with lobo in some way
Really? It's such a cool name.
"Oh damn, this is it huh"
"Totally, looked like those bismuth crystals they sell in nature shops."
"Yep. When Ultraman was revealed to be a clone (and he’s a dumb clone), it instantly clicked that he’s Bizarro and the pocket universe will be Bizarro World."
Honestly I was almost worried we'd get a rehash of the suicide squad scene where the goons knock out lex. Having krypto maul him was the perfect way to take him down without making supes look like a dick.
"> It was satisfying to see Terrific shove him out.

Yeh. No redemption arc because he chickened out and didn't want to die."
"> but they are clearly into what they do, not caring about the damage they cause unless it affects them personally.

It helps the Lex/Technobro analogy fit all the way down."
"It was literally Elon Musk and his DOGE toddlers, but written long before that happened I'm sure. Kinda funny tho."
"Exactly yes, in the Mr Terrific fight you even see one of them trying to attack him with their clipboard."
I was told I was reading way too much into it but the people in the haven where the portal entry was all seemed like Gen Z tech people who create things without thinking about the repercussions of what it is they've made. Engineering without morality.
"I loved that Pornstache didn't get his redemption moment because Mr. Terrific was like 'F off, I don't need you.' Whatever, dude, you aren't any better than the rest of them."
"Well and also unlike Barr, the Gunn tweets weren't actually that bad and were just obvious edgy jokes, not, you know, hatred like Barr was spewing."
The audience not really giving a shit and a show without it's previous title character carrying on for 112 episodes without her is pretty incredible.
The look on the kid's face said it all. The middle finger projections from Guy taking down the tanks were classic.
"Yee yee ass?! Three hundred and twenty\* women say different!

*^(\* Or however many it was, my memory's not that good.)*"
"I dunno, some guy destroying the tanks trying to kill you with giant glowing middle fingers is pretty punk rock. That kid's going to hang up a Guy Gardner poster in his room someday."
This movie had some kind of grody scenes I didn't expect. A lot of close-ups on hitting the eye with the Kaiju in later the nanites in Superman's eye that made me kind of squirm in my seat.
It was nice to see the guy get what he deserved. It gets tired to see superheroes catching the bad guys and just trusting that putting them in jail will keep people safe.
"“Hey what kind of alien is Hawkgirl?” 

“Latina”"
Lex knows the difference between a villain and supervillain.
"Its honestly one my favorite things, so many studio heads and directors would have just made it a super computer but this is just more fun and cool. Rule of cool"
"The squirrel was a big moment for me. Honestly, I can't stand the squirrel around my house. But it showed Superman as the best of us. 

And then when he was sitting on the bench talking to someone. At that point I was literally crying. Zack Snyder did *not* understand Superman. This movie does."
And Mr. Terrific having no patience for that! Was a great way to show how Superman is unique and a bit out of step from the Justice Gang.
You’re in.
"To be fair, every dictatorship wannabe is staffed with those kinds of assholes. See: Trump Admin I (lol), but also legions upon *legions* of failed states, corporate nightmares, scam farms, ~~Hollywood executive suites~~, etc.

Shit, even a few dictatorships end up like this. By the end, Milosevic's Yugoslavia/Serbia was held together with duct tape and prayers, even as they murdered dissidents in the thousands. Mix that with tech bros, you got LuthorCorp."
He must have really enjoyed the audience reaction to Starro’s eye-related death in The Suicide Squad.
"I was cackling inside when he tried to pull the “oh, you’re like Superman, you wouldn’t kill me” line. Boy, you misread that so bad"
"Great, now I can't help but think of Hudson's line from Aliens. 

""Somebody said alien, she thought they said, illegal alien and signed up!"""
Seriously! It feels like such a long time since we've seen a real proper *super*villain in these movies. Lex was so incredibly extra
"Lex was such a great rich guy supervillain. Besides Hoult's incredible performance in the role, he was dealing weapons and throwing people into personal prisons, doing unethical experiments, and had a full private army + metahuman muscle. All because he's the biggest hater alive."
It set up perfect answers to all future complaints about power scaling or why Supe wouldn’t instantly beat most of the villains; he was holding back and trying not to kill them.
"That’s something I’ve been thinking about, so many villains in these comic movies over the past few years have so much more grounded motives and character. It’s been a while since we have had a legit supervillain with style."
When Clark told Lex he was envious and he was like « well DUHHH» lmaooo i love self aware villains
"I loved the scene where he reveals he isn’t killing Superman for any of the other shit going on, he’s orchestrating it just because he wants to kill Superman. Even he didn’t seem to really buy his own speech, he’s just evil… and now he has been unshackled from the necessity to pretend, he should be even more outrageous in the next one. I generally don’t like repeat villains but I loved this portrayal so much I’d rather he returned than not."
"god damn, British people hate this movie lmao"
"""But it’s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn’t any gravity to the world around him""

  
I bet whoever wrote this was delighted with it."
Never felt like the review thread was going to swing the box office weekend so much as this movie
"“it’s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn’t any gravity to the world around him”

I just know Erlich has had this one in the chamber for months lmao"
gonna hold off and wait for the snyder cut
Alan Tudyk out here building a robot voice career. 
What I’m mainly learning from this is that the British will hate this movie apparently since the most negative scores are the UK lmao
">Edi Gathegi, on the other hand, is the standout human performance in the film, playing Mr. Terrific like the protagonist in a 1970’s Blaxploitation film. His superhero is part Denzel Washington with a healthy dose of Richard Roundtree. Gathegi’s line readings are a riot. It’s like he was born to play the part. If DC wants to spin off a television show from this part of their universe, call Edi Gathegi. - Forbes

The death of quiz trivia about a black superhero who doesn't have black in their name or lightning powers. I used to pray for times like these. Joking aside, its great hearing that he's one of the films highlights. Mr. Terrific looks like he jumped right off the page, they even kept the 'FAIR PLAY' sleeve, always loved that motto and its meaning. I'm hoping that he'll hopefully get some more attention from DC now that he has prominent role in Superman. The Terrifics might be on the table if the film is a success. 

[Superman has been on a great streak lately](https://i.imgur.com/QRwTqeW.jpeg)"
"Reviews are about as expected. 

Solid blockbuster with a good message, a lot of fun, but narratively uneven and sometimes inappropriately timed humour.

Sounds like James Gunn."
"I just don't want it to be boring, and these reviews seem to suggest it's not. Not that I thought James Gunn would make a boring movie but I didn't want him to play it too safe."
"Just watched it. If I had to summarize the whole story its very similar to the plot of a good DC animated Justice League episode. 

I also think they nailed the characters. They stayed true to the source material with Superman and especially Lex.

If I had anything bad to say about it is that its very lighthearted and there’s no character development at all with Superman (he basically ends up being the same as we was at the start of the movie with the exception of a few realizations about himself). That said dont expect things to get to deep"
DC smoking cigs right now.
"Looking good overall. Honestly, it sounds like a James Gunn movie and that is definitely not a bad thing."
"Sounds like it's flaws are kinda what I'm hoping for, a denser world with more stuff going on. "
Superman saving the squirrel was peak Superman
Time to see if a man can still fly
Deadline’s dig on Guardians 3 is insane
Not a big Superman fan but I am excited to see it. Strong start to reviews. 
"Variety is crazy saying Iron Man 1 is ""just good"" and in rhe same league as Thor. And for saying Guardians 3 is terrible."
I feel like you could see the movie being overstuffed from a mile away.
">*Superman* suffers from overload, much like Gunns’ *Guardians of the Galaxy* trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the *Babe: Pig in the City* treatment.

WTF does this even mean? Did people not like Guardians 3? Bloody hell."
Insert Denzel relief gif
"DAAAAAMNNNN that was fucking insane, movie just ended.  Superman was unbelievable!!  An absolute must see multiple times!!   Funny parts and really dark ASF parts.  Man James Gunn killed it.  The best Superman since Christopher Reeve."
"So it's a fun movie with some good portrayals of the main characters, but without a lot of depth to the side characters and way too much James Gunn humor.

What I expected"
Being hopeful as a DC fan is certainly a new feeling...
Anyone notice the Gotham City sign during the evacuation scene?
"Brits and Irishs united for once, lol"
"I can see this being mid 80s-late 70s in terms of score. It’s been said to be trying to do a lot and from the reactions I saw, I knew it’d be a bit mixed to positive. Regardless, I’m excited."
"See a few complaints about it feeling rushed/bloated and noticed the runtime is barely over two hours.

I’m happy we’re moving away from every superhero movie being 2.5+ hours but for a movie designed to kick off a new cinematic universe I do wish it was slightly longer.

Will reserve final opinions for later after I’ve actually seen it but I feel like too many superhero movies lately have felt rushed due to their <2 hour runtimes (sans credits) and hope this isn’t another one to add to the list."
"Damn, everyone except for Europe seems to be feeling it."
I feel like it might end in the mid 80s. Reviews were never gonna sway me anyways (unless it got a zero maybe lol) the general consensus on the negative reviews seems to be people tired of Superhero stuff and it putting more focus on that over the characters.
"Just watched this movie today in Korea. I actually really enjoyed watching it, especially because it was such a fresh perspective on the ""human-ness"" of superman. For the first time, I felt like Superman had a distinct personality, and it was fun getting to know his character better through his mannerisms and choices throughout the movie."
This movie was fucking awesome. Everything ive ever wanted in a superman movie.
What did Gunn do to the UK? All of the negative reviews are coming from across the pond 😂
r/Snydercut might be the most delusional sub reddit I’ve seen
"Variety putting this on par with the early MCU stuff is a good sign to me- those were very solid movies, especially compared to some of the modern MCU, so Superman being at that level would be a breath of fresh air."
Super man is so fucking back!!!!!
"I love that the dudes saying it was going to bomb critically, are ignoring the reviews and saying they were ""sadly right"" etc"
"Pretty much exactly what I expected. Positive reception overall but hardly glowing - lots of people mixed on it.

2/5 from Empire, that's quite surprising considering they tend to be very kind to nerd stuff."
"If it's even half as *super* as they're saying, I'm in."
"As of right now, 72 reviews and it’s sitting at 89% 

I’m seeing a lot of top critics hating it more than just the regular critics.  Hmmm. I’d say anything over a 75% and it’ll be fine."
"I hope it’s not too much of a spoiler to say, when Superman saved that squirrel, I laughed, but I knew the rest of the movie was gonna be PEAK and it WAS"
"It was fun. Maybe a bit overstuffed in terms of characters, but I wouldn't say it was uneven. The Hammer and Hawkgirl were a bit unnecessary, imho.  
I know the whole point was to see Supes get back up over and over again, but his moment of true reflection upon the twist felt a bit rushed. A bit too reactive throughout the story, but I think it works for the portrayal they were going for.  
  
My biggest gripe was probably Lex. Especially his monologue, which I felt needed more pushback. We never really see him face his own BS, which is the best part about the character. He managed to push his grandiose justification without being revealed for the little man he really was, and I'm afraid we'll see people pop out and defend him in the coming times.  
  
Not too bleak or too goofy, it really felt like it had some heart in it. It's difficult to make the character feel threatened, but they managed to do it. I felt myself rooting for him in some fights, even as I knew he'd be okay.  
Didn't feel too cliché, the way they showed heroes and villains showing up as just another thing that happens works for the current state of the genre. Nor do they rely too much on subersion.  
He's a way better Superman than Snyder's. His whole schtick is about trying to save people, he's a bit cocky but never comes off as arrogant. Much more true to the original character.

The one thing I felt really needed some work, was his focus on doing the decent thing. It's always been a tricky part of the character to show that he'd probably do the right thing even if he didn't have superpowers.  
Being a good person as ""the real punk rock"" needs something more than a positive attitude when your hero's pretty much unstoppable. I won't go too much into spoilers, but there's a couple of points - when the world's turned against him, and when he has to pick between two battles - where it feels like he's not presenting that ideal.

Overall, it was a pretty good superhero movie. Loved Krypto. Loved Jimmy Olsen.  
Maybe it could've focused more on Superman encouraging others that doing the right thing is always the right thing - especially when it's an act of rebellion - instead of spending so much screentime on secondary characters that didn't add much. But I understand there's a lot of executive pressure to turn this into another franchise opportunity, so I guess Gunn did a pretty good job taking all expectations into account.  
  
Glad to see kid's stories that aren't all about hopelesness or feeling lonely.  
It's important to remember the good times only happen when people work hard to keep doing good.

Also Luthor as a Peter Thiel-type works perfect.

PS: The Brits are miserable. What else is new?"
"Man I really hope this is good. As someone who loved DC growing up, I’ve been really bummed by their cinematic portrayals when Marvel fans have been feasting for years. I hope Gunn can bring some of that magic to Superman and the other DC peeps"
"Doesn't seem like the Irish Times guy liked it very much:

""The cartoonish closing battles make it clear that, not for the first time, Gunn is striving for high trash, but what he achieves here is low garbage. Utterly charmless. Devoid of humanity. As funny as toothache.""

LOL. What a dick."
"I feel like I have never heard as much discourse, good and bad, about a particular movie, as much as I have about this one. 

Im watching it this weekend, can’t wait to move past it."
"I just got out of an early screening and really liked it, but I wanna see it again. Feel free to ask questions about ir?"
"I was hoping this would be the best Superman movie since II, and it's starting to look that way. This is 44 years in the making."
"A Superman movie and a Clipse album are really releasing on my birthday 

James Gunn is a top 5 comic book director of all time without discussion"
"There's been a hardcore smear campaign against this over the last few months and for the life of me, I can't figure out why.

I have no idea how this movie will turn out, but I have high hopes for it"
"Most reviews are saying Rachel Brosnahan is the stand-out of the movie.

To the surprise of nobody."
This getting better reviews than thunderbolts is solid. I loved thunderbolts
This movie was amazing
"Mediocre like 95% of the comic book movies. With three 9 year-old boys who were all bored and wanted to leave halfway through, 2 middle aged women who were ehhh, I liked it the most out of the six of us and I’d give it about a 6 out of 10. It wasn’t serious enough to be dramatic. It wasn’t funny enough to be funny. It was the biggest waste of Wendell Pierce ever. I did appreciate having the one girl who had maybe two lines and clearly her only job was to show her cleavage. The dog was just goofy. I appreciated the whole social media, modern aspect of rapidly changing opinions."
"Reviews are strong enough now that it will easily clear 100M OW. 

Should hit 110M at least. 

Gunn au have actually done it and bought DC and WB some more time."
"A super strong 8/10, not like an IGN 8/10 which has just become their definition of average. A movie that reaches for the top and occasionally hits it but falls short on just a few things to keep it from being perfect. A fantastic cinema experience which was entertaining, funny, and will hit you in the feelings too. 

I am ten times more excited for the next thing coming out of DC next than whatever Marvel is doing now."
"I just watched the movie, and I thought it was fantastic! I don't understand all the negativity, it felt like a breath of fresh air."
"8/10. Very entertaining, lots of heart, and most importantly the Superman that we need in this moment."
"It was a great start to the Gunn era. Because let’s be honest here, the Snyder-verse was terrible.. 

Yes, Superman was a little stuffy and crowded but it was a very enjoyable watch."
"I really enjoyed it. It was so nice to see a hopeful cheesy Superman.

All the support cast was on point and the cameo was hilarious

The kids really enjoyed it as well.."
The best way I would describe this movie is a Saturday Cartoon episode of superman done right but grown up version.
"First off this movie is one of the best comic book movies I’ve seen this year. It’s definitely a return to optimism and maybe that is what’s needed today in the world. However, its one that often tells you what to feel instead of letting you discover it. It has heart, and it clearly wants to inspire, but it moves so quickly that it rarely earns its emotional moments. The film assumes the audience already knows this Superman and this world, which makes it feel more like a sequel to a movie that does not exist.

The pacing is fast, sometimes too fast. Moments that should land with weight are passed over, and deeper moral questions are resolved with words instead of action. Scenes like Clark’s talk with Pa Kent or his speech to Lex were good, but they felt like reminders of his values rather than moments of growth. Superman never truly wrestles with a moral crisis, and the film misses the chance to make the audience question what trust and goodness actually mean.

Superman takes plenty of hits in the film, but he never faces a deeper internal struggle. The story avoids exploring what could’ve been a stronger scenario where he loses control. If he failed to protect Lois or lost someone close, and that grief pushed him toward anger, it could have revealed a version of him that even he fears. That kind of moment would challenge both his character and the audience’s trust in him.

Mr. Terrific was a standout. He brought sharpness, presence, and something fresh to every scene. Lois and Jimmy were strong too, grounding the story in real humanity. Guy Gardner added some humor, though his character felt more like comic relief than an essential piece. Hawkgirl unfortunately did not serve much purpose. Her role felt like setup for future films more than a contribution to this one. And Mr. Terrific while an interesting character and standout he basically was another Yondu.

The Jor-El twist felt forced, almost like a late-game addition to create a sense of conflict. And Lex Luthor did not feel like the Lex I expected. He came off more unhinged than brilliant, more rage than strategy. His scenes were intense, but they lacked that controlled menace that usually defines the character.

This movie feels and looks like a comic book; Its decent but not standout. The color grading and composition sometimes felt flat, almost like prestige television rather than cinematic spectacle. The score works but is not particularly memorable. It all felt like it was doing its job, but rarely going beyond that.

I get why it landed for a lot of people. It feels good to see Superman as a symbol of hope again. But for me, it did not take enough risks. It felt like something meant to entertain, leave you feeling good for a couple hours, and then be forgotten once the credits roll.

It was good. It just left me wanting more. Will probably go to a second viewing to see if I feel the same. 

7/10"
"If this considered a good Superman movie, I have to conclude I’m just not a fan of the guy. Movie was a 6/10 for me. Not a bad movie by any means, just not for me I guess"
"This is pinnacle Superman.


Unlike Man of Steel... Which Synder only ever cared about the spectacle of Superman and never the character which makes him Superman.

Which I don't blame for anyone for enjoying that film. It's a grand spectacle, but it didn't have the charm or joy that I found in Superman as a character. 

James Gunn brilliantly deconstructs what makes Superman a human being and not idolize him as a super being.

The only thing that Snyder every cared about Superman was the spectacle and conflict while making him a god.

Superman is such an endearing character, and it's completely wasted in Man of Steel.

 Plus, the Kents was done so horribly wrong in that film. Telling Clark to hide his powers and fear humans was sooo weird."
THE GUNN DIDN'T JAM
"James ""Son of a"" Gunn does it again"
"Rotten Tomatoes just Debut at 🍅91%

EDIT: debut score at 91% w/ 55 reviews. Will change as more reviews come in. But that is the debut/first score."
So excited to see this hopefully it makes a lot of money in the box office because DC badly needs a non Batman character film to actually be good.
The movie fuckin ruled
"I was fairly confident that reviews would be positive, but it's such a relief that they are. I've been a DC fan my entire life and I'm happy to hear we are getting a good translation to the big screen of Superman."
"Looking at the comments, I really am curious, are all these people droning over and over about Snyder bots or something? It's kind of unbelievable that for so many actual people the most important thing about this movie is how the Snyder fans will react?   
Seriously?"
We’re about to see a whole generation see David Corensweat as their definite Superman. It’s amazing to witness how time defying the story of Superman is.
I'm glad it's reviewing well. That eases a little bit of the nerves I had for it. I'm still going in to it cautiously optimistic though.
"I see a ot of people saying the split between liking it and disliking it is European media vs American media but I disagree, I think its more outlets that enjoy comic books, superheroes, superhero movies etc. and those that don't. It just so happens that the outlets that don't happen to be mostly UK outlets right now.

Stuff like The UK Times, The Guardian etc. they're all about reviewing ""Cinema"" and stuff like that. Ultra serious movies"
"I loved man of steel. I loved Zack Snyder’s DC universe. I’m excited for James Gunn’s DC universe. I love how both universes start with Superman. My hype level for this is unimaginable. It sucks that I have to wait until Saturday to see it, but looking at my theater booking, it’s already sold out for all the times they are playing it and I’m glad I bought my ticket in advance."
this movie have post scene?
"I'm fresh out of seeing this, and it's safe to say this is the most fun I've ever had watching a Superman film. It's fun, colorful, with camerawork that keeps you engaged, and it stays true to what it is: a Superman story. For those who are worried about it being cluttered with too many characters or plots, though I am a big comic nerd so it may be easier for me than the average person, I really didn't find it that big of an issue. While yes, the movie does feel a little cluttery, I think that's actually caused by a relatively *short* runtime more than anything. Now that's no fault of the characters either, as it was a blast seeing all the characters in the film. I mean you have the side heroes you know are in the film, like Guy Gardener, Hawkgirl, Mr. Terrific (who's actually amazing and is one of the highlights), but you also have a couple cameos in here (though not too many to make it feel like a Marvel movie). The Ma and Pa Kent scenes are also amazing, and I LOVED Nicholas Hoult as Lex, and he really played his ass off in the role. Rachel Brosnahan should also be recognized as Lois, but I feel the man who deserves the most praise for this film (besides James Gunn) is David Corenswet. I remember when he was cast as Superman, and I know I was actually a fan of the casting (I mean he looks like he was ripped out of the comics), but I also remember the hate he was getting from the dreaded Syndercultists. So that, on top of the work he did to prepare for the role, and his spectacular performance here as the Man of Steel really makes him worthy of a *lot* of flowers. For me, this really is the most comic accurate depiction to ever be on the big screen. It really is all about hope and humanity, and I also am a big fan of how it kind of just tosses you right in with metahumans having been around for 3 centuries. Whilst this isn't the best film of the year, it definitely has its place up there and is my favorite of the year so far and has be excited to see where James Gunn and Peter Safran take the DCU next. If you have questions about the film, feel free to ask!"
"I didn't know what to expect? Was the movie fun? Yes, in parts. There were some jokes that just didn't land for me. 
The movie runs along at break neck speed and hopes you don't see just how shallow it is.
Some things just conveniently happen and things work out. The dog was a bit overused.
It was like a live action saturday morning cartoon for most parts, but I still kind of enjoyed it!"
"  
The movie is Superman & Friends and is a warm, good, fun to watch and has it moments.. Its a good starting movie and mostly picks up after 30-35 minutes.. Music is great! VFX is Super.. Mr. Terrific fight scene is crazy and \[SPOILER\]Krypto kicking Lex's ass at the end is funny and satisfying.. Superman Lois interview conversation is a difficult one and Supe's anger when Lex captures Krypto shows how much he's holding back.. Corenswet might not be the greatest Superman but he is a good one and grows on you as the movie.. Justice Gang is a fresh breath of air!"
"Watched it, loved it. Great start to James’s new direction and vision for DC. 

Can’t wait for more"
"Amazing movie, loved it."
"Lex was phenomenal. I hated his guts so bad. Mr. Terrific to me was the stand out of the movie, just wonderful. Overall solid movie and watching this movie felt like having hope injected straight into your veins."
"This wasn't just the worst Superman movie i've ever seen it was easily the worst movie ive seen this year :

* Social Media typing monkeys ? 
* Terrible CGI (in 2025!)
* Green oven mitts from a unnecessary Green Lantern 
* Saving a squirrel in the middle of a battle ?
* Crowds and extras that seemed like NPCs ?
* Way to many characters 
* Another movie with an alt universe / dimensional whatever
* Can we please stop w skyscrapers falling over or getting destroyed in movies ?
* Can we also stop with skyscraper sized monsters ?

I could go on and on , maybe if i was 12 id feel different smh

I should have left when i had the chance"
"I just finished it and it’s absolutely terrible. I have issues that involve some slight spoilers that rare not even debatable problems.  If anyone is curious, feel free to ask and I’ll list them out."
"This was shallow nothing was interesting at all and I feel like James Gunn's humour is starting to wear off for me every scene has no stakes cause there needs to be a dumb joke in the end. I didn't like Superman at all or this version of Lois Lane. 

Complete waste of time and money"
"I’m British and Superman is by far my favourite superhero. Sorry to say it but this movie is absolute dog shit. It’s extremely cheesy, the funny parts are almost impossible to find funny and superman just isn’t superman, there’s nothing he does in this film to make him super as he’s made to look basically human by the villains and the justice gang seem far superior, in fact Mister Terrific, Green Lantern and Hawkgirl steal the show in the movie. David Corenswet definitely makes a good “superman” but how he’s been directed and had to play the character is very underwhelming with its writing of this movie. It feels like a a cheap tacky kids film."
Seems to be what you expect from a James Gunn movie. Great cinema popcorn movie.
"I am coming out of the theater now. The movie is fantastic, and James Gunn is a genius. David Coreswet or whatever did an amazing job as Superman."
But but leaked review said it's trash! /s
there is a reason why Manchester Black exists lmao
"When the world is gone to shit, America looks for hope. Here are the clearly defined good guys vs the clearly defined bad guys. The Brits and Irish however, we like to sit in our misery and want a bit more grit. Everyone is a bad guy but to what degree. I think that’s why Batman does well over here and Superman less so. It’s just that slight different view point."
"James Gunn’s humour is really American, if that makes sense. Our critics would probably prefer you just write everything like Frasier 😅"
"I’m almost curious now to see if there’s a regional filter on Rotten Tomatoes or similar, lol. Critics are their own person anyway, but I never really thought of how regional reviews might differ from one another until now!"
German critics seem to not really like it too. Fitting the stereotype it seems to not be serious enough and too silly.
"I love *The Guardian* but they have the absolute worst movie and tv critics. Every one of their reviews should be headlined, “I’d rather be reading a Sally Rooney novel.”"
Do British “people” overall like Superman? I’ve always felt he’s a very American hero.
"Sometimes you read a line and you can almost see the author sit back and go, ""that was a good line."""
It’s a David Ehrlich line and he is both 1) a very good writer and 2) wrong about everything all the time. Genuinely one of the best film critics to read even though I disagree with him a huge amount of the time.
"To be fair, that is a bar"
"Let's be honest, that person came up with the line and then wrote the review. You don't waste a zinger like that."
"Most annoyingly, it *is* a good line"
"It's a fantastic line, I would lol"
Literally was thinking the same thing. Whoever wrote that should be proud. Heck of a line
"Ehlrich top 3 movie critic working today, up there with Richard Brody and Manohla Dargis. He just needs to join an actual news organisation and leave Indiewire."
"It’s not surprising considering the utter strain the superhero genre is under:

1. Since Man of Steel (the last solo Superman film in 2013), over 40 superhero films have released.

2. Literally 9 out of the last 10 DC films flopped at the box office…


Overall, good luck James Gunn"
"We could still see a well received movie underwhelm financially here, I hope it doesn’t tho."
"At this rate, Superman Summers are starting to feel familiar now that this is 3rd modern day attempt at bringing this character to his fully intended cinematic popularity.

This is really like a ""3rd times the charm"" for Superman fans, and a 2nd chance in terms of DC's whole universe outside of Batman.

Speaking as someone who doesn't usually care about reviews but is a Superman fan- I'm watching this score like a hawk because I don't want to feel like this going into a Superman movie again in 2039 if this were to not ""succeed"" again."
"I’m not really holding my breath that good reviews will bump the box office, but also I’d love to be wrong"
"I love him, he loves to stir shit but thoughtfully"
Probably since the last super man movie.  It probably came to him in the middle of the night right after that review was published.
"He thought of this in February, It could have been citizen Kane he still would have said it."
"Which I believe he handles by bashing action figures together in slow while he makes explosion sounds.

It's four hours long."
"I would love the Snyder cut of this movie. Give me more Corenswet, more Hoult, more Fillion!"
"""...I went to Juilliard..."""
Oh I think it's fully built by this point.
It all started with Sonny.
Feels like the perfect career move for Steve The Pirate 
He's been building it for a long time now
Building? It’s built and towering.
It was kinda the same for Thunderbolts too I think
Peter Bradshaw at the Guardian has particular sensibilities and can be a bit of a grinch
"I work in film PR in the UK. A lot of the national press are “old guard” types, and honestly just aren’t the audience for the typical franchise blockbuster.

There are plenty of younger, passionate critics out there who would probably be assigned this stuff instead, but alas, only the old guard can cling onto non-freelance roles."
"yea lex luthor acidentally blowing up buckingham palace and then looking at the camera and saying ""well that just happned"" might have affected it a bit"
"U.K. and USA cultural differences are stark. 🤷‍♂️

The guardian are always miserable fuckers tho, even for a British paper."
"Where did the ""black people get electric super powers"" trope even originate from? It's been around forever but my comic knowledge is limited. I do distinctly remember static shock back in the day though."
">black superhero who doesn't have black in his name or lightning powers

 Bendis will always be a hack for giving Miles electricty powers.


>The Terrifics might be on the table if the film is a sucess

No way we get a Terrifics movie this close to a Fantastic 4 anything. I just got off the phone with the streets; they said they want Batman Beyond."
Does Blade count haha?
Definitely feel like Terrifics is totally on the table cuz Gunn is a big fan of them and clearly included Terrific in this and gave him the biggest support hero role for a reason.
"Lets go, give me Vixen but she gotta be the baddest in all the DCU"
"Blade, Luke Cage, Sam Wilson, Cyborg, Blue Marvel, Vixen, Prowler, War Machine, Prowler. I’m sure there’s much more."
"Just came from the movie.

Mr. Terrific stole every single scene he was in."
"Sam Wilson AKA The Falcon AKA Captain America:

""Am I a joke to you?"""
"I just finished watching the movie. He stole the show. David Corenswet was great, but I found myself wishing for more Gathegi when he wasn’t on screen. He has important scenes with several major characters, and he has amazing chemistry with literally everyone. I’d pay to watch a whole Mr. Terrific movie."
"As someone who's seen the film, Terrific and Lex were the best actors. Absolutely on fire."
Gathegi is a great actor. Dude stole the show in X-Men First Class too
"I swear if Gunn had someone in his ear saying, “maybe a little less jokey here” he’d be an absolute top tier director."
Idk he got the first Guardians movie right imo
"> inappropriately timed humour.

Fuck. If there’s one thing I absolutely detest about James Gunn, it’s that. He’s really good at making us laugh, but sometimes it’s just too much—like he can’t have a single serious moment without ruining it with comedy."
"Just saw it, I really enjoyed it."
"Just saw an advanced screening, I think it was perfectly paced"
"Yeah, I’m with you. Though I’ll add the Deadline review saying James Gunn ‘wore out the Guardians welcome’ with the third movie reminded me why I stopped reading reviews."
"This is a genuine question: what kind of character development do you want to see for Superman? He’s the closest thing across both Marvel and DC to a pure paragon of good. He *isn’t* that. He’s fallible. But he is the closest thing to it. And how do you develop that? In my opinion, you don’t. You develop the world and other characters around him and see how he manages to stay the same despite the changing world. He’s not supposed to be a reflection of humanity as a whole, but a reflection of the best of humanity. Again, in my opinion. I’m really curious to hear what character development you’d give directly to Superman"
"I loved Lex in this. I felt like Eisenburg’s Lex tried to piss you off by talking your ear off with smart ass comments (almost Joker-like) 

Whereas Hoult’s Lex pisses you off by saying so little and being too calm. just a professional ragebaiter really. but when he’s angry, he’s fucken furious. also helps that he looks the part i reckon."
Is it anxious smoking or the ecstasy of a post-coital drag?   This is the question
matthewmconaugheysmoking.jpg
"Late in the day, It’s at 86% positive & Certified Fresh.  If that’s what Gunn brings then I say hell yes."
"I love that superheroes already exist in this world. and that Superman is already aware of them. Which means you can bring in more heroes and villains without having to show everyone’s origin story.

and since dc heroes feel spread out over their own cities, rather than packed into one city. I think you can have a movie with just a couple or even one hero without having to wonder “why the fuck aren’t the other heroes helping?”."
That was so funny. Loved it.
"I love the shit out of it. Is it ""realistic"" for Superman to save everyone in a scenario like that? No. But maybe I go to Superman to see *heroic and impossible feats* not....I dunno.....watch a dude in a cape do Trolly Problems. 

He's Superman -- not Pretty Good Man."
Doesn't need to fly too high just enough will do
"Can you fly, Bobby?"
"Its funny because after Endgame I onlu watched the Spider-Man nostalgia movie and GOTG3 because I wanted to wrap the trilogu up and GOTG3 was genuinely one of the best MCU movies, better than part 2. Better than the Spidey nostalgia movie."
Hating on Guardians 3 is funny to me because it's arguably one of the best MCU movies.
"Also, why shit on the Babe movies? It's like punching a baby pig cause you think it's a funny joke"
"I wanted to make sure I wasn't nuts, because WHAT?!"
"I'm ready for fun Superman. Not boring, emo Superman."
"It says IM1 is ""next level good"", but not quite ""top teir"" like the dark knight. Which i agree with"
"WTF? Lmao. Iron Man 1, outside of the villain being meh, is a great movie. Thor 1 is like, a 2.5/5. 

And Guardians 3 is easily one of the best MCU projects. What?"
"And throwing in some Babe hate, what was that about??!!!"
And that Superman 2 is a top tier superhero movie?
I wouldn't say it's terrible but I do think Guardians 3 is overrated
"Honestly it made a cohesive storyline, the main character is definitely Superman, there’s a lot going on, but it’s not overwhelming"
Yeah there’s definitely a lot of characters and subplots just from watching the trailers.
It wasn’t overstuffed imo
"As someone who has seen the movie, there really aren’t alot of sub plots. Everything the side characters do is in service to the main story."
Did people not like *Babe: Pig in the City?!*
Sounds like this inhuman critic just really hates BABE
Ya Guardians 3 wasn’t received that well compared to the first two.
Lots of people thought it insisted upon itself
">way too much James Gunn humor.

Nice, while it's not for everyone, I'm definitely a fan of his humor"
well it helps when you have a writer/director that do not absolutely just hate the super hero genre as much as Synder did.
Seems to be high 80s! Big win
Iron Man is just barely over two hours and it kicked off a whole cinematic universe. But it also wasn't full of other superheros like this one so I get the concern. 
James Gunn makes unapologetically American films for an American audience. His stuff is really the only thing that has made me feel alienated by American media.
"I think low 80s, but it'll def be fresh."
They don’t like super hero movies as much as they used to.
"UK critics hates superhero movies in general. I think its because a lot of their movie review outlets there are like ""pure cinema"" types if you get me."
"Even setting aside the hatred for Gunn it’s truly mind boggling how out of touch those people are. I saw two users foaming at the mouth over the symbolism of a random shot where you can see Batman’s reflection, where he’s just kinda standing off to the side. They think this is deep."
Just dropped in to check it out...absolutely weird.
"I love how all the threads are at 0 upvotes, lol"
Clown world over there
I’ll never understand it. I enjoyed a lot of the Snyderverse but it’s like the Star Wars prequels: just because I enjoyed them doesn’t mean I’m going to crusade against whatever comes next lol
That this dude has a cult following is baffling.
"I generally like Snyder films, at least more than the critics. And he seems like he’s a decent dude who obviously went through some unfathomable trauma with the suicide of his daughter while trying to finish up Justice League. So I’m glad he got to release his version (even though they obviously included new stuff).

That said, I don’t understand why he has such an extreme cult following with such toxicity. Like I don’t understand why they’re cheering for Superman to be BAD. It doesn’t matter who the director is, it’s clear they would want it to fail if it’s any director but Snyder. Like why would you want any film to be bad. Like maybe I would understand if it was Roman Polanski, Bryan Singer (since he actually directed a Superman film), Joss Whedon again, etc. a person who has legitimately done bad things (or is at least accused of them). But it’s pretty obvious their hatred extends to anyone who is not Snyder."
"That's pretty exciting to me, since the ""very good"" tier of comic book movies they lumped it in with (og Iron Man, Batman Begins, first Captain America) I personally prefer to the films they listed as ""top tier."" 

(I still think Spider-Man 2 and the Spider-Verse movies are the real gold standards, though)"
Surprised at this. Even the biggest blockbusters usually get at least 3/5 from them
But will it be *Man* enough?
"Anyone, including myself, who is a comic book fan just wants a decent story to follow that stays true enough to the comics. I want to walk out of the theater and think ""that was pretty good."" Anything more is a plus

Crazy that somehow that is a tall order to studio execs."
"It's at a comfortable 87% :)

very happy"
"Gunn's humor can be pretty hit or miss, so it makes a lot of sense that a reviewer who didn't like his previous movies wouldn't like this one. I just don't get why one bad review is worth focusing on. Art is subjective. I'm looking forward to this, but I definitely get why people wouldn't like it, if it's anything like his previous movies."
"I do like the ‘high trash’, actually not a bad description of James Gunn superheromovies. Although popcorn flick is probably the more common/nicer description"
Kinda funny but also seems like it’s trying too hard?
"Meh, guy just didn’t seem to enjoy. I however love a cool cartoonish closing battle. So I’m kinda excited for it"
“I will insult the reviewer because they don’t agree with me or the majority of reviewers.”  Good lord. 
He's a dick for not enjoying the film and saying as much? Lol
Still won't be better than superman 64
I’m so hype for that Clipse album
Sling dope the color of krypto
Glad to see more hype for Clipse mentioned here! Super hyped for that as well. And have an early Happy Birthday!!
">James Gunn is a top 5 comic book director of all time without discussion

The bar is literally lying on the floor."
It’s from one particular portion of a director fan base
"It’s just a movie. Looking forward to it, feels like it’s been awhile since a superman movie"
Snyder Bros and conservatives have a hate boner for James Gunn. And they're loud.
"> for the life of me, I can't figure out why.

Back in the day, James Gunn was pretty publicly anti-Trump and sparred with various right-wingers online. Mike Cernovich was the head of a twitter campaign that ultimately got Gunn fired (temporarily) from Marvel. A bunch of the people that latched onto that campaign were big Snyder-verse fans. Guardians of the Galaxy being a huge success while Suicide Squad trying to copy it and flopping hard caused a lot of them to spiral.

The fun part is that because Gunn was gone from Disney for a while, he was available for work. This meant that DC was able to bring him in to work on their reboot of Suicide Squad. It went well, so he built a good relationship there and still got to go back to Marvel to finish up the Guardians trilogy.

There is no animosity between him and Snyder. He wrote the screenplay for the reboot of the Dawn of the Dead remake that Snyder directed. I don't think Snyder is a bad guy but his movies seem to attract people who are atrocious. There have been a lot of weird internet campaigns around his stuff as a result.

This Superman isn't wildly different than what Superman has been during the majority of his time. The outrage is similar to the outrage where people complain about Star Trek going ""woke"". They have always been that way but there is a directed effort now to take notice and act like this is some new agenda."
"There's a lot of people who are bizarrely anti-James Gunn. And instead of just not watching his movies, they make it their personality."
Why do you say there is a smear campaign?
\#GUNNSBLAZING
From PG Porn to Superman.
"Lois was beautiful and was how Lois should be.

Lex was despicable.

The Justice Gang was great too."
It was hilarious that they made him black in the TV show.
"Not everyone there though. Heck, some of the best Superman writers are Scottish (Grant Morrison and Mark Millar)"
"This is perfect, yes."
"So you guys think that other people shouldn't have a sense of hope just because you guys feel hopeless and miserable all the time?
Or am I exaggerating what you're saying?"
Brits are self loathing and proud of it. Which is depressing. Were a miserable nation filled with miserable cunts
After all one of the brits icon is a morally ambiguous but trying to be good self proclaimed doctor who annihilated his entire species and countless others while also putting his companions in extremely traumatic ordeals
I'm curious now. Did they like the Snyder movies?
"Well we already have Kelsey Grammer as Beast, so a Frasier like superhero movie is now possible "
"As a Brit, I can't even trust the audience rating on rotten tomatoes because the only way to be a verified audience member is if you live in the US, so it's just extremely biased.

I've mostly stopped using rotten tomatoes."
"Oh, it’s VERY silly. It’s peak Superman. Some people just don’t like Superman"
"Sally Rooney readers catching a stray in a Superman thread, did not expect that 😂"
"Peter Bradshaw has made some wildly bad calls, I think I've disagreed with every review he's written!"
The infamous 3 star Chernobyl review
They gave WW84 a 4/5
"I remember when they reviewed Dark Night - it was something along the lines of ""This is so implausible, I hated it"" - Like what do you go to the movies even for?"
"Never listen to the Guardian’s takes on either screen entertainment reviews (apart from the absolute savaging they gave Beast Games. I respect that) or trans people, because they are invariably uninformed waffle"
The quotes over the word people is unintentionally hilarious. It’s like equating them to the French
"Superman is like Garfield in the UK, everyone knows him but no one really cares much. Honestly I thought that was the same everywhere..."
"Brit here, he is absolutely my favourite superhero"
"I'm British, and I've always liked Superman. I used to wear Superman pyjamas to bed; I've watched all of Smallville; and I've seen the original Christopher Reeve movies countless times, well, just the first two, honestly. I've watched Man of Steel, more than once, too. 

I even started watching, although I haven't finished, the animated series from the 90s, but I should.  

And to top it all off, my mum used to pick me up and move me around the room whilst she called me ""SuperBoy"" in song. 

I am quite the British Superman fan, in a way. Never had a problem with him. I wasn't exactly bouncing off the walls for this movie, but I said to myself, I should go and see it. Looked interesting enough, and I think I might still do that despite the apparent negative reviews from the British public, which might seem unsurprising to some Americans."
[deleted]
"He’s big in pop culture and public knowledge but I don’t know if many people would consider him their favourite superhero. He’s a bit one dimensional and goody goody for the U.K. we prefer characters with a dark side or ones with a bit more of a dry or sarcastic sense of humour here. Most superman portrayals lack these things and play him off as this completely moral, dad joking type"
"Brian, from Family Guy lmao"
https://youtu.be/rBvclo7RotY
He’s gonna re-read that review for the Blu Ray release and be like “fuck yeah that was a good one.”
what's worse is you know damn well they came up with it before the watched the movie. Because they're so damn proud of it.
I used to follow his letterboxd just to read the ridiculous takes
yeah i mentally clown on him whenever i see his reviews but i *do* also read them every time
"I'll check it out. But I'm definitely getting ""It insists up on itself"" vibes from his writing 🤣"
He's incredibly insufferable.
"For the AVclub (back before it got nerfed thanks to Peter Theil and venture capital), the writer of the review for *Verotika* (a terrible horror anthology directed by Glenn Danzig) had the following line in the review:

“Glenn Dan-zigged when he should have Dan-zagged.”

I mean, is anything less than *slow clap* appropriate for that?"
"This goes for every Jurassic World review I see with a “hilarious” quip about extinction, DNA, cloning, etc…"
Wait why are good lines annoying? Isn’t quality what we’re after?
Say that again
What was the other one? The suicide squad?
is that considering only the DCEU films? i thought The Batman performed well
Maybe this movie would be like Batman Begins where it pays for the sins for the previous DC movies and its sequels are able to profit on the basis of the goodwill built by this film
Thankfully I saw somewhere that Gunn said the first few movies are gonna have some leeway because of how damaged the DC movie brand is.
Everyone said Thunderbolts was the best thing Marvel has done in ages... it struggled. Which does bum me out as I really liked it.
"I, a huge Superman fan in my high school and college years, went into Man of Steel so hopeful based on the trailer. My response when it was over was something like ""well, shit."" 

It's all in the writing. No one has written a great Superman script in the modern era."
"I just saw the movie (avant première in Belgium) and I absolutely loved it. Go see it, it is such a good DC hero movie with Superman in the lead. Also light, so much light!"
"This PERFECTLY explains him lmao, I love him too but man he can be hard to please"
"""buk-buk... bukaaaaaaaaaaaawwww""!!!"
"“Are you with us?”

“…No.”"
I DID NOT MURDER HIM.
I think my father wanted me to kill you.
He’s come a longgg way from helping his friend joust in the Middle Ages as well
Who?
Dude has been in every Disney animated movie for over a decade now. And that not an exaggeration. Literally all of them.
"Same for GOTG3 which I personally thought was a high point of the MCU, the UK doesn't seem to like a lot of CBMs"
It was never going to be his kind of film lol
Bradshaw's default rating is 3 stars. Like 50% of his reviews are 3 stars.
"> A lot of the national press are “old guard” types, and honestly just aren’t the audience for the typical franchise blockbuster.

To be fair, a movie reviewer watches about ~~1200~~ 250 movies a year, including all sorts of franchise schlock (MCU, DCU, Expendables, Fast & Furious, Star Wars, etc.)

I can see how some just burn out on it, and crave original stories, even if imperfectly told.

I find the key is just to find a reviewer whose opinions on past movies match your own.

Edit: I shouldn’t do maths first thing in the morning."
The british film reviewers are basically the same as the US film reviewers used to be unti the internet took over (and social media is very american centric when it comes to this kind of stuff)
I think it all started with Storm and Black Lightning. They kicked that off kinda like Superman did with the tights and cape.
Colour contrast maybe? Bright lightning bolts look more striking against dark colours.
"Storm, Static, Black Lightning, Miles Morales, Black Lightning’s daughter.

Is there anyone else? Probably theres actually more black characters with no lightning power"
"It started with Black Lightning, but because DC are cheap bastards... they kept ripping off the character with knock-offs so as to avoid paying royalties to the character's original creator.

Thus **Black Vulcan** on the Super Friends. And **Soul Power** in another series.

They ""Static"" showed up, and it became a trope."
"DC had Black Lightning, but for some reason couldn’t use him in the Superfriends cartoon, so they created the very similar Black Vulcan. So of the few early black DC superheros, the two most prominent had electric powers.

and then later there was Static Shock, so a lot of cartoon-watching 90’s kids would have been seeing him, maybe Black Vulcan in Superfriends reruns on Cartoon Network, and Storm in the X-Men cartoon."
Bendis also named Miles's dad after the president of the Confederacy lmfao.
"> I just got off the phone with the streets; they said they want Batman Beyond

They’ve been saying that for years and they’re ABSOLUTELY RIGHT"
"He does count, most people freeze when put on the spot funnily enough. Off the top of my head, Luke Cage, Spawn, Icon, Green Lanterns John Stewart and Jo Mullein, Bishop, Sunspot, Firestorm, Captain America, Bulletproof, Usain Bolt."
Yes he was one of the top 5 polled answers!
"There's a small chance they do Strange Adventures, what with Gunn being a fan of the comic and King being on the writing team. 

It's one of the best comics I've read in recent years and Terrific is a badass in it."
You forgot Prowler
"Honestly the jokes are fucking hilarious in this one. 

>! In the trailer, you know how there’s that giant Kaiju Superman fights? It starts small. Really goddamn small. There’s a scene where two LuthorCorp employees release it from a van and it’s like this little, hip-height, ravenous monster that just runs off into the darkness while breathing fire and the employees stand there confused lmao !<"
"I kinda hope it never changes.  I get the problem with it, but they still have to make a movie that appeals to a larger audience.  I can only think of one scene in his GotG trilogy that took it too far because it went on for too long (Baby Groot not being able to find the head fin for Rocket/Yondu), but overall, they never detract from the film.  I really think that's the big key thing.  His humor never undercuts the message or the emotional highs/lows.  You still feel it when Yondu dies later in the movie.  It's the one thing that I think Gunn manages to balance quite expertly.  While others... don't (I'm looking at you Ragnarok/Love and Thunder)."
I just saw this movie yesterday night. The funny thing is that I thought this was the most sincere any of his films have been. There are jokes but they're actually relatively more constrained I felt.
[deleted]
"I’ve seen it, and it’s definitely less jokey than GoG and most Marvel movies. That doesn’t mean it’s cynical, but Gunn doesn’t undercut every emotional moment with a quip. There are plenty of jokes but in my opinion most of them are pretty funny without ruining the sincere tone of the movie."
"Personally, when i left the cinema, the first thing I thought was how well paced it was. It didn’t feel rushed to me

I was never bored during it, but at some points I worried that since they weren’t rushing it, that they’d run out of time for the ending (since it’s not a 3 hour movie) and have to rush it at the end. but they didn’t do that. start to finish felt well paced to me"
How was Corenswet? Does he do a decent job as Superman?
My sister hated guardians 3 because it was too serious. But before said the 2nd one was too funny 😩
Third one was arguably the best of the three.
Same thing with Captain America.
"Little bit of Column A, little bit of Column B."
Yes
"I always think the Metacritic score says a bit more, and that's at 71 which is damn solid. I was looking forward to the movie anyway, but hopefully the positivity helps this new DC thing to kick off with a success."
"So then not fly at all, just leap tall buildings in a single bound?"
Just watched Thunderbolts* yesterday and I’d highly recommend you check that out. Maybe not quite GOTG3 level but easily one of the top 3 since Endgame.
Guardians 2 had pretty meh humor. The Taserface bit just fell flat.
"I really like how weird and sad it was while also being pretty funny. Plus the villain is the best out of the GoTG trilogy. 

I don’t understand why people would say it’s the weakest movie unless you just don’t like Rocket."
"I think it leans a bit too much on humour at times, especially with Drax and Adam Warlock but yeah it's a solid film."
Which sucks because Henry Cavill could have totally nailed a fun Superman but never got a chance to
Superman the Animated Series is my favorite version of Superman. What Henry Cavill was given was such a hollow representation of Superman and I will die by that. Other than looks Cavills version did nothing for me. I am excited for that more hopeful colorful Superman it looks like we are getting.
"Hell yeah, been waiting a while to see a bright colourful DC movie. David Corenswet looks great as the boyscout. "
I mean wasn't that the consensus at the time?
"I'm really in that rare group of people who thought Thor 1 was like at least a 3.5/5, at least among superhero movies. There are dozens of us!"
Jeff Bridges was not meh WTF
Iron Man 1 is still the best movie in the MCU askde from Winter Soldier imo. Infinity War and Endgame are up there but I'd argue they dont work as well as standalone movies. Infinity War kinda works if ypu voew it as a Thanos movie though
"Right!?!?! Saying it ""wore out its welcome"" is a crazy hot take."
The villain is great wym
"I thought it was the weakest of the GotG even if I thought Rocket's story was really good. Gunn does heart really well and that's what Rocket's story had. 


The rest of it was pretty overstuffed with jokes, misc characters and what not. High Evolutionary wasn't very compelling either.


Pretty good movie but definitely overrated."
"That’s what I thought from the trailers as well but I actually thought it turned out to not be an issue at all. All of the characters I thought would be fluff were well used and justified their role in the story. 

The only elements that seemed unnecessary were some of the villains, but they were all basically just there to be Luthor goons, which he needs to have."
A murderous shadow lies hard across my soul
"This is weird, the first one is the best one for sure but I thought everyone agreed that GotG2 is much worse than 3"
I'll take Gunn's humor over Waititi any day of the week.
I don't think it's necessarily the humour that's the problem but the timing of it. Placing jokes that undermine emotionally impactful moments is just bad writing at that point.
"He has the tendency to go full whacky but as long as he doesn’t do what Waititi did on Love and Thunder, it should be alright"
[deleted]
"Not wrong on that front.  I appreciate when directors try something different, but it can’t just be their entire identity (or the movie universe’s identity)"
"I'd also argue that Superman is an *deeply* American superhero.  It that others aren't allowed to enjoy him -- they most certainly are, but the character speaks intensely to the (idealized) American spirit."
"I think part of it is just that they have a different (but not worse) sense of humor.

Also, I don't think that not loving superhero movies is such a crime lol."
"No they don;t Brits love Superhero movies 

Check out the box office results from there

They are quick to point out the shit ones though while americans get butthurt over critism"
It’s like 20% trolling
"It's mostly not Snyder's fault. His movies have some consistent themes which speaks to a vaguely conservative worldview on his part, and is taken by certain Extremely Online reactionaries as a Statement. A signal of his virtue,  if you will. These guys wanted the dc movies to be another front in their culture war, the traditionalist backlash to what they perceived as the liberalized/feminized/wokeified MCU. Woke I don't think was in their lexicon at this point, but they always mean the same thing. They fixated on Snyder as a Hero of the Resistence, revved up their outrage machine, and got to work yelling about how good and popular the movies were and how mad it was making the libs. But because they're the only actual combatants in the culture war, nobody fought them over it. They were basically just standing in a circle spewing bile at each other, working themselves into a frothing rage over a liberal censorship campaign that didn't exist. Shit got real weird."
"Yeah they're very lenient, almost to the point of being unhelpful"
Did you just say... *Man*?
“High trash” is like the ultimate complement for someone that started out at Troma.
"Which is kind of his review of Superman, so it's a bit rich that everyone is tearing into him while fanboying the film, despite not having seen it."
"Oh, you don't know about the 15 minute scene where Corenswet has to fly through a bunch of rings?"
so be it pt 2 is gonna have some generational hating and im here for it
This is unironically a bar fr
"Yeah, those David Ayer fans do get a little too cult-y for me."
"They both did voices for Rick & Morty in this week's episode, playing themselves"
"I don't necessarily mind Snyder's films (minus whatever the fuck his last Netflix sci-fi franchise was called, because that was dogshit), but the following he has for directing a ton of mostly mid movies is wild to me lol. I'm not even counting those that are willing to shed blood over his Justice League cut either lmao. Imagine dying on that hill."
Ah yes the DonnerBots
"hey not me, i love gunn and snyder."
12 years. Or 9 if you count BvS.
I liked man of steel. I like James Gunns other work in the comic book universe. I’m fairly certain I’ll like this. It’s really easy to like lots of stuff
">  I don't think Snyder is a bad guy but his movies seem to attract people who are atrocious

The reason might be simpler and sadder than it seems. 

Fascism is an ideology that plays hardcore around aesthetics more than content. They will mix match nordic mythology, christianity, some roman empire salutes and some modern art all together to create a visually appealing version of the country for insecure chums. 

This appeal to aesthetics over content, is similarly apparent in some Snyder content. 300, Sucker Punch, Watchmen all were more interested in how they looked than anything they had to say. Thus the same impressionable dolts who could fall like a fascist rabbit hole are very impressed with his work. 

Their work is thus parallel but has the same target audience, so its unsurprising many snyder fans also belong to manosphere content"
I'm anti James Gunn because he was married to Jenna Fischer when she was supposed to be married to me
Zack Snyder Superman fans wanted the movie to flop in hopes it'll convince the studio to bring back Henry Cavill and Snyder.
"I keep seeing random nitpicking that suggests the whole of the movie will be bad:

David Corenswet's casting

Corenswet's ""lazy eye""

Changing the breed of dog that Krypto is


Nathan Fillion's haircut

The ""S"" logo on the costume

CGI concerns

That this movie will be ""too political""

People bringing up Gunn's old tweets AGAIN

Every day it seems like someone is grasping at straws to say how terrible this movie is going to be, but no one can say exactly why outside of some aesthetic concerns"

More like Peter Badshaw amirite 
He is one of the worst movie reviewers on the planet. He's just so... Inconsistent. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he blindly throws a dart to decide his score for a film and then writes his review after to reflect what the dart chose for him.
"His [review of Eat, Pray, Love](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/23/eat-pray-love-review) though."
I have a good barometer lately for not trusting a critics' opinion and that's if they liked Ridley Scott's Napoleon.
Probably were deep into a *Conversations With Friends* reread during the screening and only looked up to catch a few Pedro Pascal quips.

They both get their powers from lasagna and their weakness is Mondays. 
The Superman logo and the characters overall presence in pop culture is huge in America. A lot of people are very excited for this movie in the states.
He’s definitely number two for popularity with Batman and Spider-Man being tied for first in the US.
Funny how Superman has a storyline of beating the shit out of a British edgy twat named Manchester Black and it is one of the more popular storyline of Superman.
"""You proud of yourself, Bri?"" --Stewie, in a slightly higher pitched tone."

"Wonder Woman probably.

Edit: nvm I missed ""of the last 10"". It's Aquaman. Shit did gangbusters at the box office. Shazam didn't seem to do too bad considering the budget."
"""The suicide squad"" came out during covid. Its not really fair to say it bombed because it was still very well recieved by critics and fans (minus snyderbros)"
I hope so! The Batman also did grossing less than TDK and TDKR but there were alot of factors that happened that affected BO. I just hope WB sees this as an investment for the new universe.
"Probably why Gunn insists on saying that the film making somewhere around like 700M would be a good success. He’s more focused on getting goodwill for the DC brand than making a huge megahit.

Would Guardians of the Galaxy have happened without all that came before it to convince people to give it a chance?"
"Agreed. The studio shouldn’t let perfect be the enemy of good; trying to set the bar at The Dark Knight is plain unfair. 

Batman Begins is a terrific film that had something to say. Without having seen Superman ‘25, the trailers and press give me a similar sense that there’s a good balance here — reverence to the spirit of the character, but trying some creativity on."
"why do we fall?

so we can get back up. 

batman begin"
"Considering the next two films are Supergirl and Clayface, they'll probably need it."
"It was a great MCU movie, but it both paid for the sins of what came before it and had characters the general audience didn’t really care about."
"That's not true.  The animated films and television series were outstandingly well written.  For some reason, they have zero desire to let those writers tackle a live action film script, though."
"I like Man of Steel, though I do agree with just that natural feeling after that movie was released. That no matter how much I might have enjoyed it, it was far from a 4 quadrant movie and was not going to build the interest they may have desired.  They only dug themselves a deeper hole once they decided to not follow it up with another Superman but rush a universe out."
My logic is undeniable
It's called a lance... Hellooo

I think the completely different senses of humor in the US and the UK play a huge part since a lot of CBMs are quite quippy.
"While the emotional beats of GOTG3 were well done I kinda thought  the humour was absolutely awful. It just felt like the jokes = characters yelling at each other 

I also feel it doesn't have the rewatchability of the other guardians movies"
"That's why I like how Mark Kermode deals with this type of film. He caveats almost all his superhero film reviews with ""Look, this clearly isn't meant for me"" kind of sentiment. And he delights in getting correspondence from target audience members who got something from it that he was never going to."
I would've been surprised if he'd rated it highly
My introduction to it was Static Shock.
"Black Adam, original lightning man with 'Black' in his name, also a white guy lol"
Black Vulcan in Superfriends

"Everything about Miles is bizarre. His Dad is Jefferson Davis, his mom is Rio Morales, and they called him Miles Morales because Miles Davis had bad SEO."
I’ve always wondered what the fuck was up with that. Kudos to the Spiderverse films for changing his dad’s last name.
Black Lightning is too.
I'm going to be pissed if Keaton had interest in doing Old Man Wayne once and it was wasted on The Flash.

"Ironheart also doesn't have black in her name. I guess electricity is used tangentially, but she mostly has repulsor rays like Ironman."
"You forgot the other black DC character that got a movie.


Steel."
I think it’s the “without lightning power” part that throws them off so much. The specificity tricks your mind into searching the wrong info. No matter how hard you try your brain hears that and instantly goes “oh here is a list of every lightning theme powered black superhero”
If they never make >!a plush version of the baby Kaiju!< their marketing folks are idiots
I actually like the fin scene cuz it ends satisfyingly.  The slight annoyance was intentional I think.
"Only one that truly bothered me was during the big fight with Ego, they fly at each other, Ego turns into a fist and Quill turns into a Pacman.

Made no sense to choose Pacman during a big emotional moment and it was a missed opportunity for an exploding fist bump gag that would have actually made sense if they'd both chosen fist."
"He got his start at Troma writing Tromeo and Juliet, had a cameo in Toxic Avenger 4, and has Lloyd Kaufman, cofounder of Troma, as cameos in most of his movies.

That kind of humor is never leaving him."
"I enjoyed the whole thing, but I think it ended on a slow note. Kind of like the extra boat scene in Return of the King. And I didn't care for the credits scenes."
"I think he absolutely nails it. He definitely has that charm that Superman should have, and it doesn’t feel silly when he says “darn”. 

I was impressed."
More than decent IMO. I loved the whole movie but Corenswet’s (and Brosnahan’s) perfect casting and performance were the highlight.
"with Guardians 2 while Gunn didn't go full Taika Waititi with the jokes, he definitely overdid the jokes. Basically, every single serious moment was undercut with a crude joke. And the only one that actually worked was the mary Poppins joke."
"Exactly, both characters in a way are supposed to be human manifestations of core ideals at their time. Superman always being a near messianic figure no matter what sends a very strong message that “this is true goodness, and it can never be defeated”

This IMO applies to cap also but more strict to an American Ideal being much more esoteric than just pro US government. 

In supermans case his character is one to be tested, and to overcome any obstacle. To do anything else would be equivalent to saying that what superman represents isn’t as strong or enduring as we want it to be"
Best I can do is this pile of rocks
"Thunderbolts\* blew me away with how good it was. I watched it once it hit streaming and regret not seeing it in theatres. Afterward, I was thinking about the courage WB lacked when they refused to let Wonder Woman end without a stupid CGI fistfight that ruined everything the movie was trying to do and am happy that it looks like Marvel will be allowed to cook on its own, without Disney fucking things up."
I think it's really sweet that everyone sticks with the asterisk in the title when talking about it
"I think Thunderbolts* is genuinely one of the better movies in the MCU personally. It's a smaller movie, and more self-contained than most recent entries, but that just allowed it to be super crisp. Great 3 act structure for an action comedy, brisk pace, clear characterization for a whole team of people, emotional stakes, fun action, and snappy dialogue doing a lot of heavy lifting. I think it works on another level too, because it's an underdog story, and it seemed itself to be an underdog in the MCU. It was easy to root for.

It's all of what made the MCU an initial success, without the excessive build up of bloat or tie ins that other movies gained over time. Just a post-credits scene or two to hint at things to come."
"Some of the humor is great, some of it isn't. But I'd also argue the emotional bits are great."
"That movie is dark af imo, I needed that humor"
"What’s wild is the reviewer’s issue with it is about Rocket’s storyline, which is the heart of the film and widely considered the best part. If they complained about Warlock or the humor, sure. But Rocket!?"
"Henry Cavill has amazing charisma, its a shame we'll never see him as a hopeful Superman."
"I agree with this. Actors often get a lot of flack due to the decisions of other people. If Snyder told him to grimace all day, that's what he had to do."
We watched the whole series as a family recently. It's better than it has any right to be for an after school cartoon.
"It very *very* much was, Ledger won a posthumous Oscar for TDK, it was the highest grossing movie of 2008 and it was considered leagues above any other comic movie. 

Iron Man was a modest surprise success that opened the door for more projects, TDK was an event."
"Yes. IM 1 is a paint-by-numbers superhero origin story but carried heavily by RDJ's charisma. Which makes it good, not great, but also not really flawed either."
"Thor 1 was totally ""good."" Not great. Not a game-changer, nothing to boast about, but good especially for the time it came out and especially considering how Marvel wasn't quite sure how the character would translate to the screen. 

Iron Man 1 was great. Cap 1 was really good. Thor was good."
"Thor 1 is top 5 MCU for me, I’m always surprised that more people don’t love it "
Thor 1 is the best Thor movie by far  and I will die on that hill.
TONY STARK BUILD THIS IN A CAVE...WITH SCRAPS!
"I really enjoyed Thunderbolts. Especially because I dont think you need like any context to grip with the movie.

I think the thanos avengers movies only felt good because of previous payoffs.

but I think you can tell its a good movie if you can take all hte marvel names and swap it and still like it."
"Obie is pretty interesting for a good chunk of the movie, but the Iron Monger suit and fight scene are rather lackluster. I think the final battle is easily the weakest part of that movie."
"I thought High Evolutionary was an awesome villain. He's so needlessly cruel that he felt truly irredeemable, which a lot of Marvel villains fail to capture. I preferred him to Ronan, but definitely liked Ego more."
"Yeah, the consensus is 1>3>2"
Oh no
Then the movie just halts cuz you can't get to the next area.
"HEY! We’re called The Furies, put some respect on our name!"
"Gunn also said he reached out to Snyder for advice on the costume. If they aren’t friends, they’re at least friendly colleagues which makes the fan war even more silly"
"It’s honestly insane, few directors ever have had a culty fanbase like him and and I don’t think there has ever been anything close for a director as mid as him"
"It's wild that he has a very unhinged fanbase when he seems like a nice guy, sometimes I wish he would call those freaks out."
"BvS isn’t a film, it’s a war crime."
"Life is a lot better when you like more stuff, here here. 

Why spend effort on hate when it ain't gonna do shit for ya? Meanwhile I love every thing from Jbiebz to Doomcore sludge metal, and it fills my week with unexpected drops left and right that fill my life with joy. 

Loving lots means eating RICH."
"Same, except Jennifer Holland. 21 years younger than him and hot af. No one's mid life crisis should work out that well. It's just unfair. "
Henry is busy doing Warhammer stuff.
"The whole ""release the Snyder cut"" campaign being successful has given them an absolutely delusional sense of how much power they have. To think strictly from a business perspective that DC would completely scrap the decade long, multi billion dollar franchise blueprint they just made that was *already* a replacement for the previously scrapped one and bring back the thing they scrapped... It's beyond idiotic."
"Out of everything, slander of Gardner's cut will not be tolerated"
"> Nathan Fillion's haircut


What? Are they mad that *Guy Gardner's* haircut is bad? Do they get mad at the sun rising in the morning too?"
Doesn’t fox call everything woke lol
I guess they didn't know that Superman is an illegal alien and always has been an illegal alien lmao.
"I just looked it up. Wow, he's really just some dude. Was his performance good at least?"
Peter Badcall?
Guardian Film in shambles
He loved Jurassic World Rebirth for reinvigorating the franchise but hated Superman for the same thing. Truly a critic of our generation.
"Could it be ""The Batman""? The last 10 DC live-action movies would cover BoP to Joker 2."
Shazam netted more money for the studio than MoS
"Yup but as a reboot it was sure to go below those + pandemic time & capacity restrictions.

Also it was a very violent serial killer movie."
"“The Batman also did grossing less than TDK and TDKR”

That’s because it was paying for the sins of Ben Affleck’s Batman, and the general audience went “another different Batman?”"
They're making a Clayface movie? why?
Clayface has been decimated now.  The director left.  His idea is being fully rewritten but hes still on as writer (which is bound to change) and the shooting date has been pushed back to next year.  Something really fucky happened on that all of a sudden.  Also its not Alan Tudyk.
"The giant confusion when marvel was pumping out live action hit after hit, and animated flop after flop. Meanwhile DC live animation was flop after flop and animated was hit after hit."
"I lowkey love this movie. And I say this as a fan of the source material, which has not very much to do with this movie."
He will fong you
There’s a guy on our team dressed like a pirate?!?
"I do think the quips in Thunderbolts were much better written into the story than just being there for the sake of it, ala Brave New World.

Still, you’re probably onto something here."
"The fatigue is real here, and the quips don't help. Anecdotally, I don't know many people who view James Gunn's directing as all that distinct from the likes of Whedon and Waititi. They're like different flavours of the same brand of crisps."
"Yes he's my favorite film reviewer, him and Mayo work great together."
"He's called black because he's a corrupted Teth-Adam, like Dark Flash or Black Beetle. Also he wears black."
">...and they called him Miles Morales because Miles Davis had bad SEO.


Because comic book alliteration is fun. Peter Parker. Miles Morales. Clark Kent. Lois Lane."
"Actually in a few adaptations... he is. Well, the detective human form of him is."
Speaking of Martian Manhunter the Absolute version is a good read. You can feel the existential dread in the first issues
His human form was black in The Justice League right?
"eh, fits for Quill"
"That's the one part of the fight that had any creativity. They establish that they have infinite power to make and do whatever they want, and then they just punch each other really hard for 10 minutes.

It seems like Gunn had more say over the action in GotG3 (Marvel studios usually handles all of the action) because it was a big step up from the second film. Of course, I don't know for sure, but the Adam Warlock flying scenes look exactly like the Superman flying scenes in this new movie, where he clearly has creative control."
"I agree, his Superman is great, just wish we got to see more of his Clark Kent"
"yea, the scene with drax and mantis just crying when touching him hits hard.  

I also loved the gamora vs Nebula fight in it."
"You all should keep going to Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, and at least the animated Crisis on Earths animated film (the nearly 20 year old one, not the newer animated trilogy). 

It’s all a continuation of the Batman Animated series from the 1990s—that first Crisis film IIRC was based on what would have been the wider plot for a Justice League season 4. After that they soft reboot the franchise with Flashpoint, which is OK. The next 18 animated film series before the next soft reboot with the new Crisis was pretty good too. Bruce Greenwood makes a hilariously annoyed Batman (his annoyed groans dealing with magic and other things later on outside his scope is comedy gold)."
Shame how it gets overshadowed by Batman: TAS.
At least Thor felt like Thor in that movie instead of whatever he is now
"Same. Best of the Thor films. They never really got it right again. The scale and spectacle increased with every installment, but they turned Thor into a clown and lost the right mix of charm and bravado that they nailed in that first film."
"> I preferred him to Ronan

Why wouldn't you? He hardly does anything in the movie lol.  High Evolutionary was great."
In b4 the inmates from the Aslume arrive.
You get that Ayer cut yet
They did worked together before for dawn of the dead.
"I am one of the few who actually enjoyed Man of Steel, but even I had to admit BvS wasn't it.

Jesse Eisenberg completely miscast as Lex Luthor, Doomsday as a generic CGI Monster, Batman mowing down goons...seriously bad."
I mean I wouldn't mind more super Cav but honestly way more excited for all the other stuff the dude is doing
"Yes but this time is Super, so you know it's serious"
"Yes, it was! One of the better parts of the show."
"Oh yeah if the Batman counts that makes perfect sense, that movie was fucking great. I was thinking of main line DCU justice league stuff."
Shazam 2 was a disaster and wipe away all of the profits from the first film.
It was also rated R in some select countries. I know since mine flagged it as R-13.
"because he has RANGE!!!!!!!that man is already a shoo in for a star in hollywood.

/knowledge of clayface is soley based off the newer batman cartoon."
"Mike Flanagan and James Gunn are friends and Flanagan wanted to try and pull off a body horror movie with Clayface. So DC didn’t, like, sit down and say “And for our third movie— Clayface.” It was a pitch brought to them that Gunn and DC responded too

Flanagan is the writer/producer but not the director, unfortunately. In my opinion, which admittedly could be totally off base, is it’s not a terrible idea, especially if they keep the budget lower since body horror has such a cult audience. From what I understand the movie is more of an offshoot horror foray releasing around Halloween that happens to fall within the new DCU. 

It feels way more weird their second major big budget release is Supergirl. Not sure why they wouldn’t start trying to build out the Justice League more?  I know Wonder Woman is in early dev, but would’ve been awesome to see a Latern movie off of Superman. Guess they’re saving it all for the HBO show.

Still rooting for it to succeed regardless"
Because Mike Flanagan wrote a script and wanted to do it.
He deserves more of a Penguin-style HBO series honestly
"It’s an awesome sci-fi B-movie that got a huge budget and has really nothing to do with the book it took the title from. Just an enjoyable standalone film.

“That, detective, is the right question.”"
"I, Robot is a guilty pleasure of mine.

The script was originally titled 'Hardwired' and the only link to Asimov was the three laws angle. Apparently, executives changed the title at the last minute for promotional purposes."
"I view it very similar to the Keanu Constantine movie; it has little other than the name and some of the themes in common with what it's based on, but it does well enough with the material (and the cast do well enough in the movie) that it's a good time throughout and you don't really *care* that it's ""wrong"". 

Also love James Cromwell in that movie. Given how little he's actually in it, Doctor Lanning is an interesting character I wish was around *more* just to get more James Cromwell in the movie."
"Brave New World is the only MCU movie I haven't watched and that's ultimately it's biggest sin. I know it won't be bad, I just really really really don't care to watch it"
"I thought Thunderbolts got rid of a lot of the needless quiping and comedy scenes, which is probably why I enjoyed it more than some of the other previous marvel films largely."
"Sorry you're getting downvoted, because that's almost exactly what I've heard from family members over there."
"Wade Wilson, Bruce Banner, ""Bucky"" Barnes, Wally West, J'onn J'onzz, Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Otto Octavius, Stephen Strange. Even Doctor Doom or Green Goblin."
"Due to how well 'Absolute Martian Manhunter' is being received, I wouldn't expect to see J'onn J'onzz as anything but a skinny redheaded twink in anything for at least a decade."
"Which makes it the more ridiculous he was replaced by Cyborg on the Justice League in the Snyder film (and the New 52). Due to a ""lack of black teammembers"""
agreed - the fist bump explosion isn’t period for his pop culture
"“He might have been your father, but he wasn’t your daddy,” scene hit real hard too."
"Sorry bud, the Jonkler has been pulling the strings this entire time."
"I liked the Batman, but it would have been a better movie if they cut a good 30 minutes off of it."
Clayface in the Harley Quinn series is FAaaaaabulous!!! (And voiced by Alan Tudyk!!)
"Clayface has had range since the Batman Animated Series.

He’s a tragic villain in that one. A Hollywood actor who gets in a horrible car accident and is given an addiction drug that allows him to plastic surgery his face together until he gets blackmailed to do crimes using his acting skills to ruin the reputations of people the company doesnt like, and then the company tries to kill him by pouring a ton of the drug on him and it turns him into clayface."
"They’re liking trying to avoid stepping on Matt Reeves’ toes, and flesh out characters outside of the core JL."
You have my attention.
"No no, it's bad. Made worse by having the seeming aspirations of an interesting movie or asking real questions, then just *immediately* forgetting about them and really half-heartedly jingling keys."
"Watching Brave New World just felt like I threw away 2 hours. 

The writers made the villain way too powerful, so he just gives up for no reason. 

Also, it is clearly a script for a Hulk movie that they repurposed because they have no fucking clue what to do with Falcon's Captain America."
Fin Fang Foom and J. Jonah Jameson because why limit alliteration to just two names?
Officer Balls
It seems the next movie after Clayface is likely Brave and the Bold (Batman) given how far it seems to be in the writing process
"I mean, they immediately confirmed they’re developing both the Reeves’ Batman sequel along side Brave and the Bold which is the movie set in the DCU with Superman. They’re letting Reeves do his own thing, but it’s not like they’re going to never use the biggest character at DC in their new universe. Batman will show up sooner than later."
"Lol when I first found out about it I think it went something like: 

“DC is developing a Clayface movie” 

Me: “That’s stupid. We don’t really need more solo villain movies.”

“Mike Flanagan is writing and producing”

Me: “I’ll be there day one!”"
"The Incredibles films have been set in a similar retro-futuristic 60's era. And they were definitely influenced by the Fantastic Four concept.

Now it almost feels like the FF has, in turn, been influenced by the Incredibles. Which is a recipe for a pretty decent FF movie."
"I saw it last night, VERY visually appealing but very by the numbers Marvel plot. Pretty risk averse"
"I knew it’d get better reviews than the other FF movies, though that wasn’t a high bar."
"So, wait.  Of all the attempts so far, the FOURTH one was... fantastic?"
I saw it last night. It’s pretty good and very accessible if you don’t follow the MCU anymore
Chris Evans will always be my Johnny Storm but I’m looking forward to my girl Sue Storm getting proper treatment. Love Vanessa Kirby.
I just wish that one guy wasn't wearing blue contacts. It is so off-putting.
"That 60s sci-fi aesthetic and space age optimism is sooo much better compared to the doom and gloom we’ve been getting. The retro-futuristic approach instead of trying to make them fit into the modern MCU mold, they leaned into what made the comics special in the first place. 

After the last few phases of diminishing returns, maybe this is the reset button the MCU needed. Sometimes going backwards is the way forward."

"Saw it tonight, it’s fun and the cast bounce very well off one another. However, it’s not really all that  Fantastic, very poor second half with a rushed ending and a very weak villain."
Ralph Ineson would make a great villain. Love his voice
"Looks like Marvel has produced two good movies in a row. That's nice to see.

Thunderbolts* was such a pleasant surprise."
"Both superman and Fantastic four getting good reviews 

We eating good"
About damn time.
"Watched it yesterday.

Nothing special really. The beggining is nice but as soon as the ""plot"" starts to happen it get this weird pace that's either too fast or sluggish.

The third act is a mess and some of the choices make little sense, but well, they can say it's a different universe anyway..."
"I wanted to like it but found it very bland and formulaic,  with a very predictable story, the only thing that stands out are the aesthetics, it felt kind of hollow, sadly"
It only took since the inception of Fantastic Four but we finally have a great Fantastic Four movie.
"Just finished watching the film and it was... fine?

The cast was good and the retro-futuristic setting had its charm but I can't help but feel like this film had a lot cut out. This was a very quick and breezy film but I was left wanting a lot more from it. Without going into spoilers too much I just wished there had been more of the family dynamics present. Sure we get a couple sequences involving their family dinners but there's a pretty major development halfway through the film that I wish the film would have delved more deeply into and how it would affect that familial dynamics of the four main characters.

The focus of the story is on Reed and Sue and their chemistry and interactions are probably the best part of the film. Johnny Storm also get a bit to do, but sadly The Thing is largely unused other than for a few jokes. The Silver Surfer and Galactus are peripheral entities at best, they're in the film to pose as obstacles and not much else.

TLDR; The Incredibles is still the best Fantastic Four film"
"88% start on Rotten Tomatoes.

We finally have our first fresh live action Fantastic Four film.

We did it, bros."
"I saw it on Monday. The Atomic-Age aesthetic is great and carries a lot of the weight, but where is the '60s music? The greatest soundtrack of all time is handed to you on a Silver Age platter and you don't take it?

The bigger problem is with the pacing. The film is all sharp turns, no straightaways, making it feel very much like a product of the attention economy. What makes it worse it that these superhero movies have overcorrected for the reboot issue they used to have, where there was an origin story fatigue. Now they’ve overcorrected by telling us nothing about the characters, just assuming the audience already knows and cares deeply for them. It's as if they expect us to project 60 years of history onto the film's shallow writing.

">Brian Truitt - USA Today

> It’s a “Fantastic Four” movie that finally gets its heroes right, after so many tries.

Brian Truitt just closed the door on ever getting a chance with Jessica Alba."
Haven't had much interest in anything Marvel in a long time but I want to watch it just for Ralph Ineson I think he's so good in anything he does.
"Just got back from the Ireland premiere.  

If you like Marvel films I guess you'll like this. I found it felt a hell of a lot longer than its very short runtime and was a very formulaic Marvel experience."
"I just watched Breakfast All Day and they disagreed with each other. Christy Lemire liked the movie and gave it a seven, but Alonso Duralde gave it a five. he found the characters and movie in general to be boring, and Pedro Pasqal didn't have much to do. she meanwhile liked the character interplay and said she could watch a whole movie of just them in their apartment, but thought the comic book elements like Galactus were too silly."
I wanted to like it so bad but it was extremely average. They kept trying to have Johnny be funny and it never really worked. The mole man stuff was unnecessary. Sue handled Galactus basically by herself so why is Dr. Doom such a big threat?

"> this is the best Fantastic Four yet. And if that bar’s too low for you, then it’s also the best Marvel movie in years

jsyk, that's also a low bar, but i'm glad it's getting good reviews"
Superheroes movies loves a 60-70 Metacritic score
Seems to be on par with Superman with reviews
"Rate: 7.5/10

I liked it! My pros were:

\-Obviously, we know it wasn't an origin story, and I feared the exposition would come across a little silly, but I like how they did it - it did not drag imo.  
\-VANESSA KIRBY!!! I read a few spoiler-free reviews saying Pedro was the star (Supes on TikTok for example, but I really do think it was her. Every scene she was in, she was stealing the show, and I liked how she and Reed played off each other. Can't wait for those people obsessed with powerscaling to try to do so with her, LOL.  
\-Herbie!!! I giggle at the tape scene when they went into space and also his reaction to galactus. Lowkey was scared he was done for for a second.  
\-CGI/Effects - I am shocked that the stretching wasn't bad! People are definitely going to say there should have been more stretching, but I liked focusing more on Reed as a scientist/leader than a fighter when the other three characters are way more well-equipped to do that; a fresh take, for sure. The best effects were invisible women, but we knew that from the trailer.  
\-Galactus was awesome, and I like how he isn't gone - hope we see his return (and more importantly, Shalla-Bal's)  
\-Set design was awesome, but we also already knew this  
\-I like how a lot of the trailers were pulled from the beginning. I feel like we are finally getting over the major problem of revealing everything in the trailer.

Cons:

\-The end credit scene - this may be a hot take, but I did not vibe (however, I was hoping/thought we were gonna get the F4 perspective of the Thunderbolts scene, so maybe I am biased, and it will change in time). I feel like we should've seen Doom's face. What I assume we are supposed to take from it is that Franklin gets kidnapped by Doom, but not sure how believable that is when Sue just basically took down Galactus. And why would they need to go to 616? I feel like Doomsday is going to have a LOT of ground to cover, and I am not sure how they are going to fit in all of this stuff.  
\-Mole-Man/Subterranea (not sure how to spell that LOL). Kinda felt like no reason for this to be there, I mean, the evacuation could've just been a city-wide evacuation, and sending people underground does seem a little silly in the context of a huge man stomping on the city. I get that it did help give us a little background to the F4, but I would have much rather that time been devoted to references to (what I assume is a prior conflict since they were not at the UN meeting), Latveria and Doom.  
\-Johnny's crush on Shalla-Bal just felt goofy and out of place with the severity of the situation. I did like the scene where he played the recordings for her, though, but I think it still could've been as impactful without the crush.  
\-Would've liked references to X-Men/Mutants in this film, but I guess it makes sense that the F4 are the only heroes, just would've been cool (or even a throwaway line of Franklin being a mutant/having a specific mutation).  
\-No cameos :/

Overall, I liked it - couldn't decide on 7.5/10 or 8/10 so I lowballed it, could def change with time. Most of my cons are, I wish we could have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ which I think also stems from the low run time. Please reply my friends cant see this for a few days and I am DYING to talk about it LOL."
I hate how cbm are rated relatively to each other now. It reads more Ike selling it and not an actual review. .  Just rate it in isolation please.
"The plot is weak, cliché moments and the pacing is really weird. Can't wait for the official discussion smh"
"From two friends who went to an early pre-screening, the hoops Marvel jumps through to justify the post-credits scene is astounding (even for Marvel)."
"I feel like being gaslit. People are happy with this reception? It sounds like the reviews are “it’s good enough” and critics usually put on kid gloves (literally) for these kind of movies, and couch their criticisms unless it’s outright bad. To me that’s disappointing."
"Just saw it. I thought they got a lot of things right with the FF family dynamic. But that end credit scene. Holy cow, it left a bad taste in my families mouths. My wife thought the movie was mid until that scene raised it to ""dogshit"" for her. She says it makes her not want to see any more MCU movies."
Even the positive reviews don’t seem particularly enthusiastic. A lot of “pretty good”
"Fantastic Four finally defeated thier greatest foe yet.

Oh, apparently Galactus too."
"Too much baby-related obsession for my tastes. It’s a way to get an emotional investment when the audience hasn’t really connected with the characters, so I get why they did it… but they just didn’t stop throwing the baby into the act. Baby is threatened, characters holding baby, oh my god what about the baby. By the third act I admit I was kinda eye-rolling from it."
"The 2005 was good and I'm tired of people bashing it.

You can talk trash about the 2007 one (they did Galactus dirty) and 2015 all you want tho."
Let me guess — It’s a bit like the Incredibles and the goodies win at the end?
This was pretty boring to me—I’m disappointed. Superman was twice the movie. This movie had elements of greatness but just never clicked and had probably the least amount of action I’ve seen in a superhero movie.
"Probably one of the worst movies in a long time, lmao."
i hate to say this but that was mid damn. i did get chills during Doom's reveal at the very end though but the whole movie was exhausting. probably because i watched at 7 pm before i got to eat dinner but still the pacing was off and the build up to anything including the characters like Herald just wasnt there. everything just sorta happened.
The movie was sooo boring and painstakingly slow. I wouldn’t recommend
"Great start. 3 for 3 banger comic book movies this summer. In the end I think it’ll be around 80s percentile Critics, 90s percentile Audience."
Lucas Moore giving this a D and giving Superman an A is going to have people going at him hard online.
"Just saw it opening night New Zealand (The credits are rolling right now), good experience. Id say visually its **Fantastic** , seriously though the vfx team cooked with this and so did the sound design. I appreciate that the MCU seems to be picking up again with Thunderbolts and this. I had fun, will need more time to let it marinate."
It was Meh. I'm not impressed. Disappointed even.
">With an exemplary cast and shiny new alt-universe to enjoy, this is the best Fantastic Four yet. And if that bar’s too low for you, then it’s also the best Marvel movie in years

From Empire, that alone has me sold!"
Am I being gaslit that this movie is going to be this good because of the rotten tomatoes score obviously it’s going to be much better than the previous films which isn’t hard to beat. Just wish some of the reviewers said something more than it’s good enough and actually said how they felt about the film
I trust metacritic more than RT
How is Galactus in this film?
"The Jetsons meets Interstellar meets a 1950s space-race fever dream. almost like the golden age of americana dreaming of tomorrow… except this time, tomorrow arrives with IMAX and Joseph Quinn in a space suit 

Walter Elias would be proud of this film.

Just saw it on IMAX"
"Saw it this afternoon and the reviews are pretty spot on. It's well-made, beautiful production design, very silver-age-comic-y, kinda light but sincere. Really appreciate how it's not an origin story *again*. I think anyone who wants to see Fantastic Four done right and/or wants a cool standalone Marvel movie that isn't as bloated or bland as some of the latest ones will have a great time."
"First F1 then superman, now F4, I've never been going to theater this frequent and eat this good since forever!


Jurassic, on the other hand..."
Shocked the reviews are that high
"Movie is great , just you have watch it with logic shut down, tthere were just plot holes and even their society behaved in odd sort of ways"
Just back from the cinema- I honestly am very disappointed. Thought it would be better...
Painfully boring movie that was only interesting for middle and felt like a slog for the back half.
Just give up the baby.. Jesus Christ. I just couldn't relate to the movie after that. As heroes it is a small sacrifice to make in front of annihilation
My two biggest concerns are it being filled with unnecessary fanservice cameos and it being a feature-length setup for Doomsday with no satisfying resolution. Hopefully both will be unwarranted.
"I guess it was a little selfish of me to expect the movie to be totally amazing, so far it seems to be “pretty good”. Idk."
Apparently it's good in Act 1 and 2 but Act 3 is complete and utter shit.
Most reviews make this thing look like it's pretty mediocre. I think it's too early to start running a victory lap
"what a waste of galactus, could just of been godzilla walking around for 30min, boring plot, tis a shame"
These reviews are honestly better than I expected based on the underwhelming trailers
"Yeah this movie is reallllllly mid.  As someone who doesn't watch Marvel movies in general, I don't know much about the bad movies y'all are talking about but man this does not help. The story is nothing I haven't seen before, I didn't care much about the characters, it just felt like another superhero movie.  And also silver surfer caring about a baby lol. You helped Galactus destroy many planets with babies on them and now you care about the one on Earth?  Okay lol

I hate how insignificant Galactus felt in this movie too.  Man got the Hulk treatment.  If Marvel has been releasing bad movies, this doesn't break that chain.

Also, I do LOVEEEEEE the aesthetic of the movie tho.  Felt refreshing compared to the other Marvel movies I've seen."
A great summer for superhero movies
Those are the scores we want to see!
Fantastic Four: Fourth Step
With how tainted reviews have been this year you can't trust these at all.  I barely trusted review scores before but after the fiasco where scores were getting deleted from RT to boost other movie scores I will wait until real people see the movie.
66/100 on metacritic just slightly worse than the 68/100 Superman got.  Nice double feature. 
"Interestingly, [Film Authority](https://film-authority.com/2025/07/22/the-fantastic-four-first-steps/) kind of blasted it, but somehow gave it a fresh rating?"
So basically the best FF movie but nothing spectacular either.
It's hard to get the wow of MCU Iron Man but it's starting to get better
I HERALD...AND KUMAR
"I think this was a solid superhero movie and a fantastic four movie. There is good worldbuilding and the extras give a lot of life to the movie, as with the characters performance. However, I found a issue with the pace and the writing. It's like how in school you are meant to write an essay in 500 words or less, and to prove a point - and ultimately I felt that the movie barely proved its point because it wrote them established like how superman is and we did not get to see a lot of time on screen being a family nor in the tie-in comic because it almost assumes that we know they are a family. This was a 6/10 for me. Still, this is a step in the right direction compared to the jarbled, multiversal mess that has been the MCU for the past several years with phase 4."
"I’d say this was a 6.5/10, it got me more excited for RDJs Doom and Doomsday which I think was the entire point.

There wasn’t nearly enough action, the lady next to my fiancée completely fell asleep and I left the theater at the end wondering why there wasn’t more use of their powers. What we get is pretty good though. The ending also left me pretty confused at points, and I thought Galactus was underwhelming.

The family dynamic between the 4 was probably the best part of the movie. Even the dynamic between the 4 and the rest of Earth as protectors and citizens. I also liked the world building and how some of the beginning stuff ties into later (but why Evac to the underground when you can just leave the city?). Interesting to see what happens with this world in the upcoming movies."
838 Reed Richards tech flexed on 616 Tony Stark so hard.
Just watched it and there is not a lot of action. I don’t think The Thing threw one punch.
"Saw it tonight.  

Great cast.  Great suits. But not a lot of world or character building.  Story is meh.  

But anticlimactic

Galactus and silver surfer sucked.  Cosmic powers that didn’t do anything.  Silver surfer got ragdolled with ease.  Galactus is just a giant goof walking.  

And the mid credit scene.  It probably would’ve been extremely epic if this movie came out last year and it reveals RDJ as soon.  

But since we already know doom.  It felt meh.

7/10"
"Did anyone else get the vibe of tictocification? No scene lingered / no conflict (asides from the overarching plot) / no single conversation lasted more than maybe 15 seconds, and the constant quipping…maybe I’m getting old"
This is one of the best Marvel movies since endgame
"I am going to stray from the course here and say that it was fine overall, but not as excellent as some have been saying. The movie lacked any real depth, the plot was really convoluted and extremely fast paced. The characters felt hollow, and the ending with galactus, a cosmic-level threat, was… boring."
"Bro the movie was cool, are we gonna act like the thing ain’t have the hardest fits the whole fucking movie"
"To be completely honest, I think it was OK of a movie. I think I put too much expectation on it. It felt like a kids movie to me. It felt like it was something I could’ve watched at home and not go to the cinema for. Like home VHS DVD straight to DVD type felling . I would give it out of 10 maybe a  six out of 10 but again I think I’m being quite judgmental about it because I feel like it should’ve connected more to the cinematic universe. Or maybe I’m spoiled and was thinking it was gonna be more adventure action type. Idk I might have to rewatch"
I heard everyone's doubts but Pedro Pascal was actually a good Reed Richards. At least in my opinion.
Big Galactus fan here… anyone else disappointed with how the movie ended? He was usually “defeated” in the comics through either negotiation or deception.
"I loved the film but coming away from it I'm more convinced that the human torch and to a slightly lesser extent the thing were miscast. The cast didn't have a whole lot of chemistry together, which is kind of evident on their painfully awkward press tour. "
The gender swapped Silver Surfer allows Johnny to have a similar arc to what he had with the Inhuman Crystal and I get along to that idea
"Sorry, I didn’t get attached to the characters."
And the crowd goes mild!
Sounds like an average 6.1/10 on IMDB by 2026. Pedestrians CG and more meme than story.
"Jesus, Lord of God, but man, I missed the boat on this one. You can quibble with any number of things about it (like how it’s the most futuristic 60’s ever, but a baby carriage looks like something out of the Addams family) and like it or don’t like it based on that. 

But for me, the biggest sin was that it was fucking boring! The stakes while enormous felt small and relegated to a very few scenes. I guess after that, I’m excited for Doomsday, but I’m not sure why.  Clearly I am wrong, as everyone near me said they liked it as I listened in, head in hands, waiting for the post credits scenes.  Maybe when I watch it again, I’ll like it, but not today, not this cowboy…"
was Pedro Pascal as boring and lifeless as he seemed to be in the trailers?
Why is everyone so obsessed with Rotten Tomatoes? The overall score of 65 on Metacritic doesn’t exactly scream great movie.
"Just left the theater. Laughably bad movie. The plot was predictable. There were so, so, so many bad tropes. The “chosen one” baby, giant space monster imminently going to destroy earth, New York City destruction, smart guy discovers insane new technology randomly, learning a whole ass alien language in a day, mom sacrifices self for baby, could go on and on and on. The fucking baby was blatantly a different age in every scene. The CGI was so bad especially with the silver surfer. Yes the cast was loaded but sadly the acting was bad, even Pedro dropped the ball. You could tell he wasn’t really trying, dude has been in way too much lately. He phoned this one in. A failure across the board. 1/10."
I guess it's safe to say that the Fantastic Four successfully deported an undersirable alien to an unkown location.
I saw it earlier today and Galactus’ size was super disappointing like I thought he’d be 1000x the size of earth but at most he was the size of the Burj Khalifa
"Deadline calls it one of Pascal’s best releases of the year, which is really saying something because he has over 200 shows and movies coming out this year."
To be completely honest these reviews are heavily inflated. Movie was a 5/10 in terms of actual movie standards
"Seen alote of movie like Thunderbolt being said to be good but to me it felt mid, gonna have to see it myself."
Monthly slop just dropped
That Hollywood Reporter snippet sounds like Gordon Ramsay judging a dish on MasterChef before commercial break.
I remember years ago when they suggested a campy 60s based movie and then nixed that I was disappointed. Just feels perfect for them. I am trying not to get too excited - Fantastic Four is my favorite comic of all time - but I’m being cautiously optimistic about this movie
I enjoyed the movie but thought it was weird when they re-used the Antnan quantumania ending of having the bad guy sucked into a portal.
"I loved the movie, I watched the cartoons as a child so my inner child is very happy with the movie, also it reminded me a little bit of Ironman 1, simple but effective"
"Pretty Mid. Loved the aesthetics but not much else to praise or hate, decent cast with no standouts and a by the numbers Galactus plot"
Sue was great at the end
I liked it. MIDTASIC 4
"As a huge FF4 fan I weirdly don’t know how i feel about this movie, i feel like i wanna rewatch it to form a full opinion on it."
Nothing says retro New York City like the Marina City buildings
"This and thunderbolts were very good movies and is taste both very highly if not for their final fight. 

It just doesn't scratch the itch older mcu movies did."
"I like how they didn’t make another remake, they were like “yall already know the story. Here’s what happened next”"
I thought it was fine. It looks pretty. But its not funny or exciting. I wish they had ended it differently to hype me up more for Doomsday
It was exciting for ten minutes when they escaped galactus but it was just reed and sue crying for most of the movie and Ben and Johnny doing most of the leg work
"There’s parts I really like but I feel like they didn’t stick the ending. 

Superman was just delight the whole movie. I don’t think I laughed or really cheered at any point of the movie?"
"I just got done watching it. The effects were really good, the scenery and the fight scenes were colorful and not sloppy at all. The acting was really really good, I’d say it’s a good movie for the Fantastic 4 movie. That being said it did Galactus and Silver surfer so stupidly. Spoilers ahead I wondered watching the trailer how the fantastic 4 could possibly even try to beat big hitters like those two. These aren’t city level villains at all these are two thanos level villains. And they beat them as stupidly as I expected. This is a recurring issue that marvel just can’t seem to get over, is wasting their big bads. We saw it when Kang got beat by literal ants in the first movie he made an appearance, it’s just embarrassing. I expected Galactus and silver surfer to be drawn out character but there really wasn’t much to them or the fantastic 4 at all in this movie, it starved for actual character development. For someone as anticipated as Galactus to be beaten in the first movie he’s appeared in (the other appearance doesn’t really count) is just a discredit to him as a villain entirely. You can’t have thanos level villains get treated like any other big bad that can get beat within an hour and a half, even if he wasn’t technically “beaten”. And there really wasn’t much to silver sulfur at all, like I can’t say she was a bad character nor a good one, she was just kind of there to save their asses at the end. The movies ending had no stakes at all, just left me disappointed as due to the Thunderbolts post credit scene I thought they were going to lose or at least have to pay a hefty price to make it out alive against such a villain. Overall the fantastic 4 itself was a decent crew, but the movie’s plot overall and non existent character development just left me unsatisfied. Onto the biggest part of this rant was the showing of BIG SPOILERS!!!! Doom making his first ever appearance. As cool as he is you have to ask the question, who even cares. I mean the guy’s name has never even been mentioned, yet he’s the next big bad? Take away the horrible casting of RDJ, there’s literally no build up to such an essential character. Thanos had almost a decade of build up before he made a move, and doom is just there. I mean if you haven’t read the comics you wouldn’t even know who it was which should be telling to how all over the place the MCU is right now. Just overall unsatisfied with how low the stakes are, especially the ending. Good acting just the writers are back at it again ruining easy plot points. sorry for the rant just spent hours saying all this to my girlfriend and best bro who watched it with me and said they couldn’t agree more, I’d still recommend watching it if you want a good movie."
I thought this movie was phenomenal! Especially after reading the comics it really elevated the experience for me 10/10
I came in wanting a movie about a superhero family and that's what I got. The only thing I disliked was how a conflict between society and FF team was resolved.
"Have to agree! For much of it, it felt like a live-action Incredibles movie"
"I figured the comparisons would be inevitable and, if it all clicked, it would be a great vibe to throw in the mix. It probably doesn't hurt that Michael Giacchino scored both - his Incredibles score is, well, fantastic"
Mole Man!
"That’s what I was feeling walking out. I have no reason to not like it - the music, aesthetics, visuals, acting- all really good. 

But I was never surprised by what happened next- maybe other than the black hole scene. Anyone who knows who Galactus is, should expect a pretty standard Galactus story. Anyone who doesn’t might be pretty surprised and intrigued

A great predicament and character put on screen- I’m glad we got a comic book accurate version. But very predictable"
Right! I thought it was very underwhelming. I think overall Superman is a better superhero movie.
Do they win?
[removed]
But no Jessica Alba in lingerie so what are we even doing here?
Currently pacing to be higher than the last 3 combined.
"The Ratings ""FLAME ON"""
Still Tokyo Drift is better
">**EMPIRE:**

With an exemplary cast and shiny new alt-universe to enjoy, this is the best Fantastic Four yet. And if that bar’s too low for you, *then it’s also the best Marvel movie in years*.

Yeah sorry that's not really a high bar either."
How about getting a better RT score than the other three FF movies (not counting the 1994 one) *combined*. They add up to only 73%
"Saw someone on another thread mention that it got better reviews than all of them combined (I think it was on Rotten Tomatoes), which is interesting that that's even possible. Though I guess it says more about those movies than this one."
Fifth!
Say that again
Frustratingly it’s the fifth
Repeat the sequence of words that you just uttered.
...Say that again
"I get the joke, but it isn't fantastic tho, its ok."
Thank god because I have no idea what’s going on in the MCU lol
Better than thunderbolts ?
How about the actual movie instead of the visuals etc? Im seeing a lot of reviews praising the style but almost nothing about the core of it (like people solely evaluating a game on its graphics...). Can you share your take on the story or on how satisfying the movie was?
To what pre phase 4 movie could you compare it too?
[removed]
Kirby was my most excited castinf. And she killed it. She IS Sue Storm in this film.
I didn't even notice tbh
I wish ***nobody*** wore blue contacts. It never looks natural or good.
"Honestly what was that about? It was distracting every time on scene? It really wouldn't have mattered if Susan had blue eyes and Johnny had brown...

The movie was great why did they put those unnatural contacts on??"
It made him look like RDJ's monk character in Tropic Thunder. Totally jarring every time I saw his face.
"Deciding to go with a period piece was a great decision.  You've hit the mark on the aesthetics, but this is a fundamentally dated story / set of characters.  

They haven't adapted well to modern times and many works derivative from the F4, so best to stick the characters in there time and if they do jump ahead then the juxtaposition works for you."
"The Incredibles copies Fantastic 4, now Fantastic 4 copies The Incredibles"
This has been one of the things that really throws this phase of marvel for me.  No one enjoys being a super hero.....no sense of wonder.
I do find it interesting that both FF and Superman embracing a more overt Silver Age style and aesthetic are releasing within a couple weeks of each other. I wonder if it’s a sign of a change in direction
LOVE that they restrained themselves on revealing his voice in trailers.
Bloody good character actor.
"He has such a unique raw voice i recognize instantly.

He's also in the new season of Foundation.
Quite booming in that as well."
"He lives very near me, usually see him quite a lot but I was wondering why I hadn’t seen him of late. This explains it!"
“Im gun eat yet planet yah cunt”
It somehow feels lesser than the sum of its parts. I'm not sure what got cut in the script rewrites but it feels like we didn't get to explore enough of the altered family dynamics a new baby would bring. We get a few throwaway lines about how new parents don't get to sleep but that's basically it. Franklin just serves as a adorable little deus ex machina.
"Yeah, it starts off very fun and ends on a fun note, but the meat of it is pretty generic super hero stuff. Vanessa Kirby is great though."
"I’m glad I’m not the only one who feels that way! The vibe in the trailers and things I was so excited for, but it felt rushed through an action plot and lost some of the character driven stuff I was hoping for. 
It wasn’t bad, but I did leave disappointed."
I REALLY loved Galactus until that ending…
"The final fight, while it has some decent scenes, is so rushed and that “twist” end is pretty rough."
would? 🤔
Is it bad that his voice is the thing I'm most excited for?
"I loved thunderbolts, pity it didn't do so well at the box office."
"Thunderbolts was great, actually being shocked (girl getting dusted) was actually a pleasant surprise."
"Sadly I'm in the minority on thunderbolts it seems, pretty disappointing and a waste of the sentry/void characters. Yelena was great though."
"Thunderbolts was the first film in the MCU to make me full-on cry at multiple points, it has so much more of an emotional core than anything else they’ve been putting out and was really refreshing to see"
"They caught Thunderbolts just in time for them to focus more on quality (as it was one of the many projects they announced when they were focusing on getting a lot of Marvel content out, and didn’t pay enough attention to making sure it had good level of storytelling)!

If Fantastic Four is also good, then it restores my faith that Marvel will go to great lengths to make sure that Doomsday and Secret Wars are quality movies as well!"
"Colorful optimistic superheroes are back on the menu, boys and girls"
Man the bar is so low that middling 60s scores on metacritic is a win I guess. Pretty funny
"Well, we’d better. We have about a year+ before we even get another mcu movie. Starvation mode, guys."
Good Superman AND F4 movies? At least something about this timeline is good 
"They finally made a good fantastic four movie

Next step, cold fusion"
"Agreed. Vanessa Kirby, the Jetsons aesthetic, and Galactus’s voice actor were A+ but otherwise so much in the movie felt stiff, incomplete, or messy.

I feel like they didn’t really do the underlying narrative work to make us care about the characters and instead tried to use a shortcut by leveraging a baby.

I feel like Black Panther established more camaraderie with his sister in the “test this dummy” scene than anyone in F4 did with any other teammate. Oddly stiff vibes.

I did love Vanessa though, and Pedro has been great in other projects. Hopefully it all comes together in Doomsday."
Fourth time's the charm
"There is a chance it might go slightly higher

I am so so hyped right now"
"define ""We"" in ""We did it, bros."", I'm just curious"
"I get some people would have enjoyed a greatest hits style soundtrack, but let's give props where it is due. Giacchino delivered something I thought Hollywood had lost the ability to do; create a movie theme you can hum and remember long after the movie is over. Musically, it might be the best theme the MCU has produced - even over the ""Avenger's Assemble"" rallying call."
He’s negging her bro. Truitt’s got game.
"I love that his voice has been kept secret.

He’s going to cause seismic activity in IMAX."
So nothing special in your opinion?
"I feel like Marvel have learned nothing. I felt exactly the same about Thunderbolts which was similarly formulaic except like 10 minutes where it became its own movie at the end.

I think a lot of people are reading what they want to read. Still feels like the flop era to me."
The funny thing about Sue beating Galactus is she does in the comics and everyone clowns her for it because she never shuts up about it lol.
You're saying that as if Thunderbolts isn't two months old.
I honestly didn’t like Thunderbolts that much. Best recent Marvel movie for me was Guardians of the Galaxy 3.
"Of the last 6 MCU movies, 3 were great, and 1 was good at least from the general audiences opinion. The bar isn’t that low."
"I found Superman way more enjoyable, it felt like it was greater than the sum of its parts.

Fantastic Four has a solid premise but it feels like too much was cut out of it, and a lot of the heart and soul went with it."
Superman opened to 90+ iirc
Slightly tamer/weaker I would say
"I liked Superman more, but I can't articulate why. Especially because I was looking forward to Superman less, and really looking forward to F4 more. Life is full of whimsy."
"The Shala-Bal and Galactus stuff felt very disappointing.

Shala's turn against Galactus felt too unearned, and Galactus was just a skyscraper sized entity that kind of just lumbered around. Was really hoping we'd get planet sized Galactus considering we've already seen similarly sized beings in The Eternals."
I'm assuming it's a very forced Dr. Doom reveal
"> the hoops Marvel jumps through to justify the post-credits scene is astounding

What does this mean? From the leaks >!It's Dr. Doom looming over Franklin - and the leaks also indicate Dr. Doom kidnapping Franklin is a big part of Doomsday, so not sure what the hoops are!<"
Your friends lied to you.
"FF movies have been, at best, campy b-movies and at worst absolute dogshit. The formula for a good comic book movie is something we take for granted now, but if this same movie dropped in the early 2000s, it would’ve gotten rave reviews.

Superhero fatigue and the marvel formula makes it feel meh because it’s not really reinventing the wheel or anything. Everyone knows what to expect. If that’s your cup of tea, you’ll enjoy it. If you don’t like the marvel movie formula, you’ll be disappointed.

Compare that to Superman, which is the first Superman movie to have batshit crazy things like kaiju monsters and interdimensional imps, pocket dimensions tearing reality with black holes, a competent lex luthor, and a non-stoic Superman for the first time since the original films. I get why that feels like a breath of fresh air compared to FF"
"The bar is just that low for a Fantastic Four movie and in the past few years, Marvel movies in general."
It's a 6x on metacritic and you'd think with the response it got a 8x. A bit funny honestly
">I feel like being gaslit

That's every Marvel/DC premier"
These reviewers don’t just review comic book movies. Saying anything more than “pretty good” would seem disingenuous compared to the higher quality movies that release outside of the genre
"You're the first that sees the same I'm seeing.

All reviews seem to be ""this is definitely not bad"" or ""prepare to see something above ok"".

It eventually doesn't matter if the general audience likes it, but I don't see where all the positivity to this reviews is coming from."
"""Pretty good"" is the ceiling for MCU films, TBH. And it's a bar they haven't hit in a long time."
Pretty good is pretty good.
"Yeah, I generally find Metacritic to be a more useful metric than Rotten Tomatoes."
"It's reviewer fatigue in a lot of these reviews. Read the reviews for peak MCU movies in retrospect and you'll find the shift. There is more energy and wonder in reviews written for Ant-Man and the Wasp and Age of Ultron than with for Thunderbolts and First Steps. I have no doubt that Tbolts and FF will be considered far superior to some of the ""good"" films in the MCU's height of popularity."
"Just because 20 years have passed, it doesn't make shit movies suddenly good"
"Now I’m wondering how I would have experienced the (2007) movie differently if galactus wasn’t just a massive space hurricane. I still thought it was terrifying at 9 years old, but I’m not sure if it would have had the same affect with a giant armored/colorful space being as something much more familiar as a ‘natural disaster’ look"
"Not gonna take this revisionist history. As a lifelong F4 fan, that movie was bad. Did it have some good moments? For sure. Was the cast mostly pretty decent? Also yes. But it had a lot of problems.

The movie looked amatuerish, like a TV movie with a big budget. Doom was well casted, but his actual charactarization was very bad. As much as I like Jessica Alba, she was miscast as Sue Storm and her perfomance was pretty bad. The action was lacking and wasn’t cool when it did happen. It’s full of every early 2000s superhero movie trope and not in endearing ways. 

I think Rise of Silver Surfer improved on the first movie a lot, but absolutely fumbled so hard adapting Galactus that it ruined the entire movie."
"I didn't hate it at all. It could have been better, but anything is better than Fan4stick.

 Hell, I'll watch the Corman FF over that. At least it tried to be faithful on a zero budget."
"Revisionist history. There were some good, but god Jessica Alba was awful "
"I very much grew up with the 2005 & 2007 ones, so I agree with you"
Except it's a lot less inspired.  The action in The Incredibles is cracking.  It's pretty dull here.
There’s little action and can be pretty boring.
Post credit scene had more applause than anything in the movie
Which is still higher than the last three Fantastic Fours combined (Corman not counting since it didn't officially release).
"Well from what I know from a friend, there isn’t much action in this movie. So if it works for you as a family focused film with a short runtime, you’ll enjoy it."
"They just saying different things.


Rt just tells you that 80% of them people that saw it thought, hey this was okay or better.

That's about it. I'm not quite sure why people use it personally, but I guess it has some value"
Big
"I don’t think there’s any cameos in this movie, aside from maybe a post credit scene"
"different universe, so cameos won't be a thing til probably the end."
Feels like every damn film falls apart in the third act these days
"It's mediocre. Not bad, but not great either. Just a solid superhero movie, but for some people (including me), 'just solid' isn't good enough"
A lot of users here on Reddit are saying the same thing as well.
"it’s mediocre on the surface level, but when you investigate deeper it gets worse. Straight up a boring movie outside of the space flight and meeting Galactus

example: Ben having these really ominous scenes where he looks at the woman he’s interested in, but it leads to nowhere. That’s all the character work he has, and then he basically does nothing

the entire drama of the film amounts to nothing because Silver Surfer feels bad after killing thousands of planets. Really stretched suspension of disbelief but whatever opinions. Reed and Sue coming to an agreement also fell flat for such a supposedly big moment, it hard cuts to them using Franklin after a whole movie of conflict."
"I actually liked the trailers ( score carried a lot ), for me what worried me was a small TV clip or whatever they realease a while ago, that to me showed me a bit too much of a plot point of the movie.   
Showing that, to me, doesn't show confidence. and the press for this movie compared to Superman was lackluster (Not just the scale, of course Superman was always going to go all out, but the interviews and press were emberrasing)."
"“We make sure to have a family dinner on sundays”

“Oh yeaaaaah oh yeaaaaah” -ben

“Hi” -johnny"
I’m shocked the reviews are so high—feels like critics are getting bought out nowadays. This is no where near a 9/10 movie.
[removed]
Marvel movies dont seem to get that high scores on metacritic. X-men and First Class have the same rating and I'd be pretty happy if its as good as those
I realized you can't trust Rotten Tomatoes scores anymore. I've just seen too many highly RT rated movies that I simply found boring. I became convinced there's studio manipulation behind the RT scores when I saw movies actually using their RT score in advertising. It's like the Better Business Bureau: pay-to-play model
Because they’re hopeful and need a reason to be excited going into the weekend
"Yeah, that happens in the comics. His size will even change between panels. It's whatever artists need"
Haven’t seen the movie but Galactus is supposed to be able to change his size and look different based on the planetary race observing him. 
The incredibles is still the best fantastic four movie
the UNDERMINER
"I think they missed an opportunity to have him played by Danny DeVito, but he might've stolen the show"
"I enjoyed it but yea did not really reinvigorate me into the MCU. 

The acting was kind of flat. But that could be a good play for Marvel. They really need to thread a needle where the recurring heroes are relatable, but not so epic that it becomes difficult to recast/replace them."
"[SPOILER]


















Yes and there is literally 0 sacrifices or repercussions. Lackluster ending and lazy"
They recorded Pedro Pascal staring at the camera for six hours and test audiences gave that a higher score than the last two fantastic movies
"I feel like I'm the only one ITT that doesn't hate the 00's movies. 

Even rewatched them recently and, while they're not nearly as good as their contemporary superhero flicks (Spider-Man, X-Men and the first 2 Nolan Batmen), they're not bad at all.  

People are treating them as if they're in the same tier as DareDevil, Elektra and Catwoman."
"Cry pretty, Jessica."
Are there 4 fantastic 4 movies?
So anything higher that 10% basically
Not on Metacritic
Thunderbolts?
Are you including the Corman one there?
Technically the 4th continuity though!
The 2000’s one and it’s sequel are lopped in together
That busines with Corman doesn't - doesn't count
It’s Fant4stic
Fanta5tic
That's fine. Niether does the MCU.
"There's not much to know. I believe the only things you need to know went heading for the new Avengers movies is that there's going to be two different set of Avengers teams, one lead by Captain America and one by Yelena. 

And then whatever happens in the Fantastic Four. 

I believe anything else that will need explaining will be explained in the movie itself, no need to watch anything else"
"Personally, I liked it better"
I loved Thunderbolts so this’ll be interesting to compare to.
"For me thunderbolts is better, but Superman beat both. Superman just have the ""heart"" man. No wonder GOTG3 (james gunn too) is the best marvel movie after end game saga"
"I thought it was decently emotional. Pedro Pascal’s performance as Reed actually got to me. 

He truly feels like a desperate genius with the weight of the world on his shoulders, to the point that it actually gave me second hand anxiety. 

There are a lot of good emotional and dramatic interpersonal moments between the four"
"Hmmm I’m not sure…

Maybe Captain America: The First Avenger? It feels more earnest and self contained in its own little retro world"
"Saw it tonight! She was, well, FANTASTIC. 😆 They all were, top to bottom. But Sue was done dirty previously. Played for sexy laughs and not given her rightful place as a super badass. I’ve loved Sue since I was a kid reading comics. I’m just beyond right now. The heart and soul missing, imo, since Steve left, has returned."
She really ia my favorite part of the movie.
"Depending on the hue, they work fine on people who already have light colored eyes.  Blue > Gray > Green.  It’s when dark eyed people try to wear them that they really look awful."
I have never noticed anyone wearing eye contacts or even people’s eye colors at all.
"Hollywood,  we can accept that siblings have different colored eyes. The blue contacts are creepy!"
i was wondering why his eyes looked so off when he was crying during *that* scene towards the end of the movie
The whole movie I was thinking this dude looks like a CGI recreation of a young RDJ. 
"And “fish out of water” stories are good starting points for character development. Establish the family in their time, bring them to the current MCU timeline, hilarity and drama ensue, in perfect Disney/Marvel format."
Is it a period piece? I'd read it starts in the 60s but multiverses itself to contemporary marvel timeline by the end of the movie.
Down to having Michael Giacchino write the music
Reluctant heros have been getting pretty annoying
"It was excusable in Thunderbolts since everyone in it was very depressed lol.

But this is one of my favourite things about the new Superman, him enjoying doing what he does and saving people."
"if you don't watch any of the tv spots, they basically only ever reveal his shadow and him jay walking in new york."
Reads a book a week.
I was really surprised at how little the Foundation did with him
She was definitely the stand out
"I was really disappointed he ended up being the size of an apartment building.

Like I expected him to use his size morphing powers, but instead he was just a 100 ft tall mech without any notable powers just swatting at the heroes like he was King Kong."
"Honestly, it was ridiculous and so predictable"
I think it’s more like *would*
No because that's what I'm also excited for
Honestly I 100 percent believe its because captain america 4 sucked so bad. With thunderbolts only being 2 months after it left a sour taste in everyone's mouth.
It's kinda what happens when you lose the audience's trust and interest. Less people are willing to turn out.
"I don't even know most of the characters in that movie, that's why I never saw it. Plus sticker after stinker for the MCU."
"I liked it, but I think I expected more. They spent a good half of the movie or more with the team still stuck in Val's bunker. We only get to see Sentry fight for like 2-3 minutes before becoming the Void, and then that part of the movie feels like its over before it even has a chance to breathe. I think they spent way too long putting the team together so the climax basically flies by."
"Also, the comedy was actually used well and didn’t ruin all the serious moments the movie had.

Red Guardian being a goofball and everyone dunking on Walker the whole time fit what the characters were going through."
"> and a waste of the sentry/void characters

But wait, aren't those characters (in theory) still possible? >!Bob is still alive and part of the New Avengers, right?!<"
"One of the dullest Marvel movies easily. Just went through the motions. It’s the classic ‘all the anti-heroes will team up and become good - together!’, all telegraphed and repeatedly stated throughout the script. 

By the end I felt nothing honestly, Black Widow had a much better emotional thread."
"No, I'm with you. It didn't really work for me either. But I also saw it after others were already really hyping it up, so maybe I went in with my expectations just too high. But I didnt find any of the characters particularly interesting, or charismatic, or funny, and the movie just didn't do much imo."
Almost fitting that it's the very superheroes that basically launched their respective comic publishers
"Interesting flip from the 2000s - the time when everything, comics included, got darker due to 9/11 and the War on Terror.

A DC story that attempted to tackle this wave of cynicism was *What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?,* which later became the fantastic film *Superman vs. The Elite.*"
Room temperature take: we don't need multiple of these movies a fuckin year. It's exhausting. I'd rather they take time to make good movies that can stand on their own than churn out samey slop multiple times a year with diminishing returns
Great time to be a movie fan and/or a comic fan!
The Incredibles was a great F4 movie.
Technically 5th if you count the Corman one I guess.
"Fourth time is fantastic, you might say"
"*Fifth

90’s, the two from the 2000s, Fan4stic."
"Well it's not being brigaded by bots and Snyderbros, so definitely."
I just watched the movie and I legit can’t recall any music from it.
"Yes. Disappointed that the fun retrofuturism setting and aesthetic didn't really come across tonally. Expected something a bit more whimsical and light-hearted maybe?  

Caveat that this is the first Marvel thing I've watched since the last Spider-Man so I'm far from a diehard fan."
"I thought Thunderbolts was pretty good. As far as I’m concerned, as long as the writing is decent and I care about the characters, the now signature formulaic Marvel style humour and film pacing is absolutely fine. Of course, deviations from this are welcome but I really like Bucky, Yelena, Red Guardian, and the US Agent + the theme of depression and found family hit for me so Marvel simply managing to coherently bring the group together to form the New Avengers was a good ol’ time."
"MCU was always formulaic, *especially* at its peak. That's really not the issue and defintly not the lesson marvel needs to learn. Its the writing and acting talent that went down the drain."
First back to back great MCU movies in YEARS
"I'd say two were great (Thunderbolts and GOTG3), one good (D&W) and the rest can stop existing for all I care."
The bar is in hell if you're a movie fan and not just a marvel fan. The only good film of the past 6 is guardians. Deadpool had commercial success but was honestly just cameo after cameo in between fan service.
"Superman was 82 on RT and 68 on Metacritic on the original review thread so it's a similar ballpark


You might be on about the RT audience score which is in the 90s"
I remember before when the trailers were coming out and people complained about this a lot of people said something like “oh galactic can change his size!” And i think they shouldve gone with something like that - like you seem him the size of the planet and then shrink down to fight the fantastic 4 - could have showcased his arrogance too if done correctly.
For spoiler reasons: no comment
">!There’s another scene, apparently.!<"
"I’m sorry but that’s not true. 

I was obsessed with movie reviews as a kid, and critics  then were much harsher toward summer blockbuster movies. A lot of movies that are well liked now were trashed back then and I think would have had decent review scores today, esp because they’d be inflated by all of the geek sites now. The first FF movie was trashed and flogged. 

And we had the Raimi superhero movies then. That was the gold standard, better than most MCU movies, and even then only the second movie fared well with critics. It was the 2010s when the poptimism started, and run of the mill superhero movies started to get good review scores. 

That being said I’m sure this is better than the first FF movie but critics in the 00s would have been absolutely harsher than today."
Likely a direct benefit from competing with beyond mediocre earlier adaptations of fantastic-4.
"Yeah, gotta remember most movie critics aren't actually comic book fans or nerds in general. Even if some of them are still good, I have to imagine reviewing a genre you don't care about constantly gets a little old."
"It's ""well \*cast\*,"" not ""well casted."""
If true
"Word is they cut most of those, including a scene with John Malkovich as the Red Ghost"
Supermans 3rd act goes hard as hell
"Honestly, the post credits scene of the thunderbolts gave me hope that there'd be something interesting in this movie. That maybe something went wrong in order for that scene to be possible. But no. The characters are only rewarded for their childish decisions. No one suffers (yet). I hope there are tremendous ramifications for what they did in this movie, cause everyone gets off scot free so far. The more I think about it the angrier I get. A generic 24 episode of a fantastic 4 cartoon would have more depth and cultural worth."
"Marvel has always put out a gazillion of TV spots and small trailers and clips with too much information in the weeks before a movie comes out. That's not new, it's just regular business for them."
Like how they asked a question and then downvoted the answer lmao
"because the bar for a high rating on Rotten tomatoes is incredibly low.

the site is basically a ""yes or no"" system, which means if you like something 7/10, it's still a ""yes"", while metacritic will keep the 7/10.

if everyone thinks a movie is average/good, it will be 100% on RT, but only a 6-7 on Metacritic."
Sure that's the comic version. In the movie it's obvious that that isn't the case.
"I remember that ""leaked spoiler"" claiming Galactus wins which forces the FF into the main MCU but it seems they went the lame route"
How is it lazy? It fits with the tone of the movie. It'd be far more lazy to just go the doom and gloom route of everyone loses. The movie is meant to be optimistic and show what people can do when they come together. The idea that they should've lost feels so uncreative.
"TBF, you can't trust test audiences- they gave us the theatrical ending of I Am Legend and almost got the squirrel scene cut from the new Superman movie"
"Hah like Gene Siskel's great line to the effect of: ""if the movie is not an improvement over watching the cast have dinner with each other for 2 hours, it's not a good movie"""
Don't forget the penetrations
It's still wild to me that they demanded that she cry more prettily. How the hell did anyone get away with that.
"5 now, technically. Everyone forgets that one was made in the early 90s."
"There are if you only count movies that introduce the cast.

90s, 2005, Fan4stick, First Steps."
"There may be 4 Fantastic 4 movies 

...But there aren't 4 fantastic Fantastic 4 movies."
Or GOTG Vol 3? Or Black Panther: Wakanda Forever?
It's the best one so I hope so
You know it!
That is technically correct!
Never say that again.
"Thunderbolts and F4 apparently start steering the ship to a goal again, so they're figuring it out now."
"Can’t wait for people on the subreddit to have debates on which is the better Marvel film of 2025! 

I think most people would agree that Brave New World certainly wasn’t it (but I think it was still a victim of the phase where Marvel was focusing more on quantity over quality, and couldn’t save it no matter how many times they reshot it)"
I think I will too and I loved thunderbolts
Cool. Excited for Friday
Same. Loved Thunderbolts and can't wait for Fantastic 4.
"Sounds good! Loved that movie, thanks for the answer"
"You might need contacts (please, not blue)"
And once secret wars ends they’ll say oh the FF have always been in the mcu they just got lost in space or something. Secret wars is just gonna be the crisis on infinite earths for Marvel
Thats why captain america was so good.
"Based on the thunderbolts credit scene they end up in the main universe somehow, but for this movie it’s entirely a period piece."
"If the majority of the time the characters spend is in this alternate 60s universe, then yes, it’s a period piece"
"To be fair, the guy excels at writing optimistic music, which was shown in his [Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFDj7rsN0KQ) [Trek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY6tqng1ozI) themes."
His score for [LOST](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lrjs93NIaJY) is still the best
Now i want an MCU edna mode
that's why the red guardian was so endearing— he really wanted to be a hero and he believed the thunderbolts* could be the new avengers
"Jay walking ~~in~~ *on* New York

""NOBODY STEPS ON A CHURCH IN MY TOWN!"""
How can I hate women? My mum’s one.
"I would say it was because the characters all originated from different properties and it felt haphazardous. If you think about it, Thunderbolts was a continuation of Black Widow, TFATWS, Ant-Man 2, and Wakanda Forever (minimally). That's an odd mix that would've worked in 2018, but for some reason didn't now."
"I think it's also because those are all characters that general audiences aren't really that familiar with. And yeah, combined with the fact that MCU movies aren't necessarily automatic ""must see"" films like they were pre-Endgame."
"I think it was that combined with the stigma of it being a ""sidekicks"" movie with all supporting characters and no real stars."
It's also because all the characters came from unsuccessful D+ shows. A random person who sees the poster wouldn't recognize any of the characters. At least with Fantastic 4 the characters are still recognizable.
"Agreed, and oversaturation on TV."
Yelena-Alexei dynamics as dad and daughter work well for me. Dude is a really supportive superhero dad.
Yes
It was as enjoyable as drinking soda that was poured yesterday.
Golden age of hero movies has ended. This month we enter the Silver Age.
"It's a little counterintuitive, considering that the zeitgeist of the 2020s is bleaker than ever. The vibes feel far worse than the early 2000s ever were, even post 9/11. 

But dark and gritty pop culture was so prominent for such a long time that it seems like the opposite is now fresh regardless of how people feel about the state of the real world. And perhaps there's an element of escapism to it as well."
"I'm ok with 2, maybe 3. But when it was like, 3 movies, 2-4 shows is when I got burnt out."
"Yeah, I absolutely *adored* Superman but I'm cool to wait a year for Supergirl. I thought I was done with superhero movies but Superman brought the interest back, best not to overdo it for now."
"Not to mention movies that require ""homework"" i.e. watching their Disney+ counterparts to understand who the characters are."
"When we watched the trailer, my daughter asked if it was a live action remake of The Incredibles."
"Corman is the 1st, then there's the 2005 one (its sequel doesn't count), and third it's Fan4stick."
Say that again
Say that again.
90s never actually released so technically 4th.
"I’m not a die hard fan either that’s why I was asking. I was considering checking this out but if it’s just another middle of the road MCU film, I’ll pass. You’re not the only user I’ve seen saying that’s what it is."
"Didn't we go from GOTG 3 to Deadpool and Wolverine? Or is there some terrible nonsense in there I'm forgetting?

Edit: Literally as I hit submit, I remember the fucking Marvels movie came out inbetween so never mind. I wanted to like that one but then they hit the dancing planet and I was done."
"I’m just talking from general opinion. Most people (not just on Reddit I’m talking in the world in general) would agree that D&W, Thunderbolts, and GOTG3 are all great superhero movies, The Marvels is just fine or good, and BNW and Quantumania are not good."
"Of the last 6, ya got

* Thunderbolts: Good

* Captain America: Brave New World: meh

* Deadpool and Wolverine: Entertaining

* The Marvels: Fine enough

* GOTG Vol. 3: Spectacular

* Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania: Yikes"
"Marvel fans are definitely overrating Phase 5. I'd say Guardians was very good. Thunderbolts was good. Deadpool was fan service good, but not anything really more. 

I still think they have a problem with these movies blending together. These movies work better when they have their own distinct identity. Even with Thunderbolts it just felt like more Marvel, not like its own thing. Black Panther 2 and Guardians 3 were the last time I felt like an MCU movie could stand on its own"
Superman debuted with a 91% critic score and then gradually went down to the low 80s.
"I meant when the embargo lifted, it was 90+ with 50 or some reviews iirc, then gradually dropped"
"when the embargo was first lifted, it debuted with 91%, then gradually dropped down to where it is now."
"I'm gonna take that as a yes. They've more or less confirmed it leading up to release, if ever so ""vaguely"", but it sounds like they are, uhm, *really* stretching it based on what your friends said. As in you REALLY have to suspend your disbelief even for Marvel."
Correct
"The director said in an interview the other day that the original Fantastic Four from 30 years ago, in the infamously canned Roger Corman movie, make cameos throughout the movie. They also showed up at the premiere yesterday. He said it was because he felt sorry for them."
"John Malkovich as Red Ghost isn’t a cameo though… do you know what cameos are? That’s like saying Pedro Pascal playing Reed Richards is a cameo because he’s a famous actor playing a character in the film. Red Ghost is a F4 villain.

A cameo would be like Miles Teller or Ioan Gruffudd appearing in the movie playing alternate versions of Mr Fantastic."
Yeah if anything it has a weak first act and then just keeps picking up steam
Yeah that would’ve raised the stakes and of been a much better ending. They went the uncreative and lazy route.
"They also almost got ""Part of Your World"" cut from 1989's The Little Mermaid.

One kid fidgeted, and after Jeffrey Katzenberg saw that he nearly decided to remove the song entirely to save time."
The squirrel scene is one of my favorite moments in that movie.
Those bastards also made krypto getting punched cut
I’ve been to a couple of test screenings. Test audiences are kinda terrible. More than half the audience loved that JLo Netflix movie Atlas. So fucking bad
"I'll never forget many years ago walking through MGM Grand in Vegas and they have an area where you can be a test audience for shows (not sure if movies were involved, but definitely TV). We walked by and they asked us if we wanted to watch some TV pilots. We declined, but it's kind of insane that some tourists from, like, Nebraska, are the ones helping make decisions as to what gets cut and what stays."
Where does My Dinner With Andre fit on that scale?
"It was the 2000s you could get away with a lot, like anyone else remember all those countdowns for certain celebrity teens 18th birthday"
"From memory, it wasn't just to cry more prettily but also to *die sexily* in the second movie. Just a whole lot of wild shit from that director."
"Marvel didn't. The cast from that was at the premiere and >!as far as I know, cameo in the movie.!<"
The 90s FF cast made an appearance in this
Before this there was 1 fantastic Fantastic Four movie and it was called the Incredibles
"BP2 was a mess, people give that one leeway just because it’s reverential to Boseman."
Or Deadpool and Wolverine (in enjoyability because writing-wise/plot-wise it's not great)
NWH and D&W were very enjoyable. GOTG3 or Thunderbolts were probably the best all around films.
">  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever?

lol"
The best kind of correct!
It’s Fant4stic
"Ok ok, it's F4ntastic"
"Yes, they will both actually progress the story towards Avengers: Doomsday instead of having random tangents that go nowhere."
"Random aside, a month ago I was browsing records in a flea market, and I came across the Trouble Man soundtrack. Never seen the movie, I just recognized it as that album Captain America was recommended by Future Captain America, and it was three bucks so I grabbed it.

Hot damn, but that's a good album. Thanks for the rec, Sam!"
"They were also cast for Doomsday before Thunderbolts even came out, so we knew they’d be joining the rest of the heroes somehow."
"I'm gonna guess Galactus does his thing on the 60s Earth but they get sent to present time MCU based on what Mr Fantastic does. 

They have to retcon the 60s Earth in order to get the F4 into the MCU. 

I could be wrong.. but it just feels like Galactus was the perfect vessel to do just that."
What I wouldn’t give to let him compose for Mission: Impossible and let that score swing again. Bring back the bongos!
"I cry at ""Moving On"" all the time"
Hollywood and Vines is a sick but short piece. IDK why but it's the main piece of music to stick with me from LOST. I know he wrote the music for Medal of Honor Allied Assault (goated soundtrack) and I always felt there was a little bit of WW2 in the Hollywood and Vines piece.
"The way the score swells in ""Walkabout"" towards the end gets me every damn time..."
"he really wanted to be a hero

oh wow, i did not even realize the trend of ""reluctant hero"". Maybe that is why red guardian is one of my fav of thunderbolt"
"I really hope Galactus stretches Mr Fantastic out, ties him to a kettle and throws him over a pub."
"I think it was low name recognition characters combined with fatigue. Had the first Guardians movie came out now, it would’ve done Thunderbolts numbers too"
"And more importantly, IMO, it was the sidekicks and B-listers from those properties - the closest thing to an established, recognizable ""main"" hero was Bucky and Yelena... And both of them were last in movies as supporting characters / co-lead with someone substantially more popular.


There just wasn't as much star/hero power to draw folks, since it was basically an origin movie in itself. They're fun characters, but *none* of them had a fanbase like the mainstream Avengers."
"> I would say it was because the characters all originated from different properties

You're not wrong- Feige did an interview saying this is literally the reason for the unpopularity."
Dont forget hawkeye (yelena after black widow)
"It's the biggest issue I have with Marvel since Endgame. Not that the past stuff was easy to keep up with,  but the new stuff is absolutely exhausting.

I was catching up to all the Marvel stuff I missed over the last couple of years, got to Marvels and at first I thought it was going to be easy since I thought I saw all the previous stuff few years ago. Nope. Kamala Khan I saw the show, but how did she get a bracelet? Grandma something? The black woman is Rambo something? She got powers from Vanda, right? Skrulls? Kree?? Come on! After 15 minutes I concluded I need to go back to refresh on everything because I was was completely lost. And that's me, basically an uber nerd, only one above me are the Marvel superfans, if I am confused, how the hell do they expect casual fans to keep up?

Thor 2 sucked, everyone agrees, but going into Thor 3 all you needed was to know Thor is the big dude with the hammer and bisexual brother. Meanwhile, newer Marvel movies feel like continuation of a TV show and it picks up right after the mid season finale. And they don't even give you the courtesy ""previously on..""Just expect you to know."
"I guess it depends on how the youth feel about the period.  They're obviously not big fans of Trump and his policies, so that colors media works.  

To contrast, folks were more positive about Obama, though it also had that tinge of YOLO-ness to it due to other issues like climate change and man-made events like the rise of ISIS."
In 2021/2022 they put out 18 projects in two years
"I am cool with 1-2 DCU movies a year, and 1-2 MCU movies a year. Maybe they can coordinate with each other to just do a new one of each every other season. DCU January, MCU April, DCU July, MCU October"
"It’s neither Marvel nor a film, but when I went to watch Season 3 of _The Mandalorian_ I went ‘what the fuck? What happened?’

I cannot believe they undid a bunch of the conclusion of Season 2 in a totally god damn different show I’d never even watched. It felt absurd."
"“Long answer ‘yes with an if,’ short answer ‘no with a but.’”"
4fan4tastic
That again
The movie was meh. We get 1 big action sequence at the end and the rest is them hanging out as a family and the stuff you see in trailers. Nothing special at all
"I personally don't think Deadpool and wolverine was a good film, I understand why it was a crowd pleaser but as a film it was a big drop from the other two Deadpool films"
The singing planet was the most comic book thing these movies have done in a while.
"Yeah I get what you meant with your comment but felt the need to share my opinion that after having watched D&W two times now, I realized it wasn't as good as I thought when I got out of the theater. As for The Marvels and BNW I've seen a lot of comments saying those were good to great (and that critics are delusional) and there I was watching both at 2x speed because I wanted them to end so badly."
Ah right fair enough
"I'm of the opinion that, in order to enjoy any content Marvel makes now and going forward, you have to throw your brain out the window to try and enjoy it. None of it makes a lick of sense."
Is it >!Nomad coming in?!<
"That's a different sort of cameo though, more akin to what Stan Lee did."
"yeah... thats not exactly what cameos mean dude.

Rhino is a Spider-Man villain, but he showed up in The Amazing Spider-Man for like a minute. Dr. Strange showing up in Thor. Wolverine in X-Men first class. Daredevil in No Way Home. Those are cameos, regardless if they are villains or heroes **from different stories**

Cameo is a famous actor or celebrity showing up for a short role in a movie. In established IPs it can also mean a character showing up for a short scene.

The MCU is absolutely full of cameos, almost all of the movies have multiples."
"Its amazing how tone-deaf suits are.

They wanted Steve Martin to voice Goofy in The Goofy Movie. Not Steve Martin doing an impression as Goofy, just himself.

They almost cut the song ""Show Yourself"" from Frozen 2, which i enjoy more than ""Into the Unknown"""
Its so good. It perfectly encapsulates who superman is in a way Snyder couldnt for several movies including a 4 hour cut that did not need to exist
And removed the week title cards
Who punches Krypto? The Engineer?
No need for the Nebraska strays :| Omaha rocks
It is the scale
What about My Dinner With Andre Dinner with Abed?
16th in the UK 😬 the infamous Page 3 of The Sun newspaper 
"Oh man, this brings back an ancient memory of an old MadTV sketch about the Olsen Twins turning 18 and everyone was a sick freak, waiting for the exact minute."
It occurs to me that the era of shoehorned-in annoying girlbosses and heavy-handed gender politics messaging in modern media is a direct backlash to just how fucking toxic Hollywood was to women and sexual minorities ~20 years ago. And now it seems like we're on the cusp of a backlash to that backlash as the pendulum swings back in the other direction.
At least people used to fake wait until others were 18.... I'm looking at you Trump and the rest of the Pedo-Protectors on either side of the aisle.
The director said it in an interview the other day. He said it's because he felt sorry for them.
True. Can we now say that there are 2 fantastic Fantastic 4 movies?
"Might give it to Guardians 3 though, it was pretty good but also bittersweet since it ends the mainline Guardians team. Sad movie."
/r/unexpectedfuturama
We complain when we had to watch everything to follow the thread and we complain when we don’t.
"This is one of the biggest issues the MCU has had since Endgame. 0 direction for any other movie after it. The only ones that worked were film ending their trilogy. Examples, Spiderman No way home, Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool 3. The rest has been utter garbage. Granted I've yet to see thunderbolts, but I've only heard good things on it."
"To be fair, Jonathan Majors abusing his GF is a big reason as to why it all went nowhere."
"Guardians is a much better movie than Thunderbolts and it is completely seperate from the MCU, so it doesn't have all the homework and baggage assossiated with it. It also was I believe the second best performing MCU movie at the box office at that point, outperforming the likes of Captain America. 

Thunderbolts is good compared to current MCU movies, but at the end of the day it's still just a decent movie that's in the mid field of MCU movies. And let's be real, it looks like a TV show and even the trailers make it look like a TV series. It just doesn't look all that great. Guardians on the other hand always looked like a big, blockbuster sci fi movie and was recieving widespread critical acclaim and rave reviews from audiences."
I disagree. Maybe not as good as it did but it would have done fine. The actors were bigger box office draws and word of mouth was huge for the first guardians.
"It's pretty much ""Avengers for sidekicks"", or B-vengers"
"Her role in that show wasn’t referenced at all in Thunderbolts.

Which is a shame because I want the fun dynamic between her and Kate Bishop to continue."
Forgetting Hawkeye is an MCU tradition.
"> And they don't even give you the courtesy ""previously on..""Just expect you to know.

I don't know about that - I've always felt like Marvel films generally do a good job with including expository dialogue that includes what you need to know, or what's actually important for the story."
"I don't want to derail this thread too much, but I have lots of pet theories about this.

I strongly believe that the combination of algorithmic social media and smartphones is at the heart of why the 2020s feel so much worse than the 00s ever did. Obviously, plenty of bad things happened throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, but politics didn't dominate our day to day consciousness nearly as much. 

Now the omnipresence of glowing screens in our hands or in front of our eyes every day, combined with the deliberately addictive and anxiety-inducing infinite scrolling feeds, makes politics feel inescapable. Weird culture war shit seems to infect every aspect of our society like a noxious cloud, down to the personal level. All of this creates an overwhelming sense of cultural malaise in our time that wasn't nearly as severe even in the worst years of the 00s."
"Agreed. The first 2 movies feels like a movie. Deadpool 2 especially I really enjoyed. It's the kind of craziness that really fits Deadpool. 

This one feels like fan-service filled galore in 2000s superhero movie script. The actual story is incredibly mediocre."
"I honestly enjoyed the singing planet, I thought it was silly and fun. I also liked the three leads interacting and almost anything with Kamala or her family. All of the rest was pretty disappointing, especially the third act."
"Bro is lying to you, it was just the >!F4 cartoon opening!<"
who the fuck is that?
"Doesn’t a cameo have to be an insignificant role with no bearing on the plot? Like a character running past Alfred Hitchcock in one of his movies, Trump in Home Alone 2, Brad Pitt in Deadpool 2, etc."
"You’re correct, but the original comment was obviously referring to multiverse cameos, which the MCU has been infamous for the past few years."
"They definitely make a lot of bad decisions, but you generally don't hear about all the times they made the right ones."
"They cut “When Love is Gone” from Muppets Christmas Carol, which was the emotional crux of the whole movie, then proceeded to lose the film negative for the next 30 years."
"The best way I've heard it described is ""Superman is a firefighter, not a cop."""
The snyder cut is so fucking ass
Ultraman
Did it to britney spears too. I remember that countdown shit for her too.
"Well... yes. Feminism *generally* works like that. Its not some third wave thing. Used to be women refused to shave their legs and arm pits as protests 50-60 years ago. Or... go on hunger strikes.

Men have never liked any of these things. Esp not the ""hairy women"".. which is why women did it. Usually ended in violence against them because men are apparently *super* emotional?"
"Ah, I didn't know they revealed it already. It's great though, they got fucked."
I am glad the documentary came out because it showed how everyone really tried and was screwed completely.
Yep im so excited to see this movie lol
I honestly think Guardians 3 is the best Guardians movie overall.
and James Gunn's involvement with Marvel Studios as well.
"I liked Guardians 3 because it was so detached from the rest of the MCU.  It felt fresh, despite going back to previous storylines in the earlier movies.  I agree with some others too, I thought it was the best of the trilogy. The other two movies felt like they were too focused on Quill and the rest of the team was just along for the ride.  It felt like a proper team in 3 where everyone got equal footing."
"Pretty sure everyone agrees that the MCU was significantly better when the movies had a clear goal, purpose and marching path. If anything, I'd say you have to watch everything to follow the MCU more now than ever before."
"Seems like some of us always need to have something to hate at all times these days.

“What a horrible way to live!”"
"Yes and no. Kang's overall arc was flawed.

If he was going to be the big bad, he should've been introduced in a feature film, not a show. This significantly increases broader audience engagement. Or better yet, they should've incepted and created Loki as it's own movie.

Secondly, having his big feature appearance be a loss to Ant-Man in Quantumania, while delving too much into his multidimensionality, affects how threatening he feels to audiences. You can't just tell audiences that he's dangerous while making him feel like an ephemeral entity."
"Guardians 1 would have been behind Iron Man 3 and Avengers when it finished its theatrical run, but that’s pretty good."
"Guardians came out at a high point for the franchise. Avengers 1 was a huge hit and there was massive hype for the sequel. People wanted more Marvel back then, at a level that they haven't since Endgame."
"You could have a point about the actors but I may be misremembering but Pratt wasn’t as big of a pull as he is now. GotG1 is what made Pratt (also Batista) Hollywood regulars. I would argue Pugh, Sebastian Stan and Julia Louis Dreyfus have star power."
"Actually, more like the C-vengers. Ant-man, Falcon, and Black Panther were already closer to the B-vengers, so characters adjacent to them are even further."
I was really hoping for at least a Hailee Steinfeld cameo in *Thunderbolts**.
"That's true. They get all the blame and no credit. 

Case in point: Kathleen Kennedy for Star Wars. Hated for the sequel trilogy. On the flip side, gave Andor everything they needed."
I'm glad I wasn't the only person confused as to why I never heard that song except for the one time I vaguely remembered it as a child.
Also somehow had the best Thing costume of the bunch.
You don’t though. The vast majority of post Endgame movies and shows hardly connect to each other in any meaningful way.
Pratt was on the rise but Bradley Cooper was big at the time and Vin Diesel was still really well liked at the time.
[deleted]
They even reprise it during the last scene...but it comes out of nowhere without the original.
"I'm pretty sure you two are saying the same thing, and that when the other person said ""more now than ever before"", they're referring specifically to the two latest movies in F4 and Thunderbolts*, since both feature two groups that will definitely play a big part in Doomsday"
Both true but also both only voice actors which diminishes their impact.
"She seems to give the creators a lot of control, faith and support. She wants them to create their vision. 

That worked well in Andor, and terribly for the sequel trilogy. You don't want the creators to have no control either, but there's (ideally) a better middle ground where everyone's skills are combined to produce a tempered product."
Jack Quaid lookin like Max Payne
Praying hard for Mickey 17 🙏
I worked on Sinners this past summer. it was a fucking blast and it's def gonna be one of the biggest surprise hits when it comes out. I haven't heard many people talking about it yet but they will!
I really have no interest in Snow White... but DAMN if the Queen's outfit doesn't go hard.
He looks perfect as Superman
"Okay, how long has Ballerina been coming out now? I know they did extensive reshoots on it, but still? It was announced like... 5 years ago?"
"Hopeful for Superman, but Mickey 17 might be good too. Others? Meh."
I still can’t believe people pay to see those awful Jurassic World movies. Completely terrible each and every one
looking like max payne
The picture of Quade for Novocaine looked like a Max Payne movie there for a second.
"I thought I was looking at a picture of Henry Cavill, they both really got that look down"
"Really excited for superman, but that picture is _bad_

Hate the blue tint in the black"
As if we need more superman or jurassic park movies.
Another year without a requiem for a dream sequel
I'm gonna guess the new Jurassic whatthefuckever is gonna be a Deep Blue Sea ripoff.
Another Jurassic World? Just let the dinosaurs die already!!!
I’m not watching Superman with out Henry Cavill
"I never had complain of all Superman costume from Reeves era all the way through Cavill era, but this current one,..i really didn't like the new Superman costume."
How is Mickey 17 different than Moon?
The whole movie has a blue tint because the cameraman is a Fremen.
"Wow, one whole picture. Spoilers!"
"Ballerina is going to be super bad 

Don’t worry people on here gonna keep defending Ana de haram"
"idc about Ballerina, Superman or the other soulless sequels. Give me Wicked 2, part 1 was such a blast!"
"That eyesore teal is bleeding into everything with *Superman*. His hair, his forehead, the sunlight over his shoulder..."
"James Gunn is personally going to get superman shelved for 30 years. He will blame the snyder fanbase, but really it's just a bad movie"
His suit is so shit 
Cool. 4 of the least interesting movies Uber ever heard of
One-word movies are usually bad.
"I still can't get over how stupid that premise is. If anything, he should be at disadvantage with not feeling the wounds and just bleeding to death."
And just read this after I posted almost the same thing. It’s crazy how much I thought that was Max paying for a second.
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8055888/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk


Reminds me of this movie."
Even mark whalberg makes a better max payne
Didn't read the book but the premise sounds great and the trailer was really fun
"I’ll be crushed if it’s not good. Bong has… not made an outright bad movie yet though, so I’m probably overly worried."
It sounds exactly like the movie Moon.
That’s awesome! What did you do on the film?
I really hope some of the action sequences come close to the level of From Dusk Till Dawn
I saw the one trailer and was immediately intrigued; it's one I've been waiting for!
How was Hailee
Will it be too gory for someone that can't handle that stuff? I know the premise and won't spoil it.
I'm still just absolutely baffled that Gal Gadot continues to get work like this 
I find it hard to believe that that Snow White is fairer than that queen. 🤣
"Not only that, but we just had few of these movies with Hemsworth, Theron and that Twilight lady."
I’m keeping receipts
What is it with Disney Princesses requiring to have eyes that are too far apart these days?
It’s just a black sequined dress.
I don’t know if she’s evil by all that black or not tho
"totally! i think he has a great clark kent look. he could totally go under the radar at work but if you looked at him an extra second you’d be like “hmm that’s a pretty handsome guy, huh?” without being a jacked/chiseled superhero with glasses"
Looks like the guy who played the Cavillrine... whats his  name again.
looks too young
He looked like a male lana Rhoades. Unsee that
"Well, this newest one at least has Gareth Edwards directing, in addition to the writer of the original JP movie. Maybe things will improve."
"I mean at least they cast absolutely thirst trap paleontologists this time. Bailey is a huge upgrade from Pratt, and ScarJo is in it. So there’s that at least."
I’m weirdly excited because it’s directed by Gareth Evans
"Us dinosaur fans have it rough, it's the only thing we have haha. 

I can still enjoy them, with a bucket of popcorn, some beers  and chatting with a friend next to me.    We know they're not good but we still enjoy watching them."
I like dinosaurs
Same. At least Bryce still had a nice wagon in the first one but after that… yeah..
Trained velociraptors is what killed the Jurassic World series for me. A total bs.
they’ll stop making them when they stop making hundreds of millions.  But at least this one has a much better chance of being *enjoyable*.  They got David Koepp writing again and Colin Trevorrow isn’t involved at all
"I feel like this one could be more hopeful than the rebooted installments. Gareth Edwards has a fanatic sense of scale with CGI (probably the only positive I took from Godzilla (2014), the writing was extremely iffy but it looked fantastic). It’s allegedly going back more to its roots with people stranded in the wild with dinosaurs which should be much better than the slop they’ve pushed out since 2014. 

Idk, I just love dinosaurs and the original Jurassic Park- I hope it’s even a 1/3rd as good and I’ll be happy."
"The latest Jurassic World had 1 billion dollars revenue.

So.. people want to watch them and to be alive...

Don't watch it if you don't want to."
They won’t 
"Less isolated environment, is a dark comedy and goes a bit more out there than Moon does. Source: the book and Bong Joon Ho going wild."
Bigger budget and bigger star I guess.
"> haram

Uhm..."
🚩
isn’t wicked 2 a sequel??
Superman isn’t a sequel though
Huh
What are you basing this on? The superpopular trailer? Some woke thing? What is going on here?
What do you mean?  Are you saying movies with one-word titles are usually bad?  Because that's a pretty ludicrous thing to suggest...
"Yeah, him sticking his hand in the fryer seems like, even if it didn't hurt, there goes your hand. Gone. Burned, unusable."
Isn't it kind of like the premise for *Kick-Ass* in a way?
That's a damn good point.
Or extreme ligament damage.
"From what I have heard, the book is not that great, but Bong Joon Ho has made some changes. For better or for worse? we'll see."
Was thinking the exact same thing.
"I worked lighting. really just got lucky. they needed a ton of additionals the whole production and I knew some of the core guys. they got me on and the best boy kept me pretty much the rest of the show. it was a really fun experience, especially seeing a director work with basically unrestricted financial creativity, at least it seemed like that. lot of long nights but also a ton of stage work at the end so it balanced out. plus the crew was great and that always makes any show better

edit: spelling"
another coogler/jordan/Göransson joint! it's gonna be wild. especially the soundtrack. Goransson usually creates beautiful and memorable scores but this is going to be his best. they showed us a sizzle reel with his music cut to the footage and it was unreal. plus some other spoilers that you'll just have to see in the film. it's very unusual for me to be hyped about a project I worked on but this one was special
"she was super nice. didn't go out of her way to interact with people on set but she didn't hide away like a lot of big actors do. she was in the shit with us a lot, by which I mean outside in the Louisiana heat and humidity, day and night. I like what happened to her character in the movie. it's gonna be super cool to see the whole thing. Michael B Jordan was really cool as well."
"it won't be horror levels of gore. it's got summer blockbuster, r-rated levels of violence. you know the premise but I promise it does something others haven't in this genre. it's a very unique vision from Cooglar in a very saturated genre."
"~~Kal-El~~ Snow White, No!"
"I dunno, she hasn't blown me away in any performances but I think reddit talks like she's far worse and less charismatic than she is...I thought she was pretty good in *Death on the Nile* (2022)."
Is the queen going to act sexy and pull out a gun for 2/3rd of the movie?
Why? She's charismatic enough and probably good to work with.
She seems pretty ideal for the role. The Snow White and Superman castings both seem off to me. 
"To be fair, the whole point (IIRC) is that the queen is the ""most beautiful in all the land,"" but is set to be ""overthrown"" by Snow White once the girl comes of age. 

Either way, the PR and development nightmare this movie has undergone is astounding."
"It's a pun. ""Fairest"" also means ""whitest"" or ""most pale"". Snow White is called that because she has skin as white as snow. So the mirror showed the Queen the ""fairest"" (as in pale skin) not ""fairest"" as in most beautiful."
"Mirror Mirror (the one with Julia Roberts), I've heard is supposed to be the good one out of the recent bunch."
Least porn addicted redditor
"> I mean at least they cast absolutely thirst trap paleontologists this time. 

Excuse you.  Sam Neill is standing right there."
"Can confirm, going to watch it because my GF, who just doesn't know it yet, has the lead role!"
[deleted]
"Right, like where else are we going to get our dinosaur fix? Until Hollywood decides to kick off a Turok film franchise, this is the best we got."
None of the *Jurassic Park* movies ever let me down like *Dino Crisis 3* did.
Most dinosaur media in general is just terrible and we take what we dino-fans can get between rewatches/rereads of Jurassic Park.
"I was really hoping that 65 would give us another great dinosaur movie, but nope."
I like turtles
What? Her wagon just got better over the series.
"Same. I was a dinosaur kid, read the original books and loved the original movies. 

The newer ones just haven’t been it."
"I don’t plan to, I gave up on them after the second one. I was just giving my opinion. If you don’t like it,move on."
"Plus, I think him being aware of what's happening drastically changes the story..."
"Yeah, that's true. Been a little harsh with my words haha, just way too hyped for any movie that is no regular franchise film, especially after 2024 being this frustrating and dull"
"Plenty of trailers have been super popular and bombed like hiroshima.

Gunn succeeded at Guardians (sort of).

This isn't the superman the public wants, it's what Gunn's fanbase wants and they are wrong"
"They're usually ""in the background"". Like... if someone said ""Hey, do you wanna watch \[insert one-word title here\]?"", the other guy would be like ""What's that?"" because there are 75 other movies with that same title. As a result, they often aren't in the public's eye. That could be an unfortunate truth that has nothing to do with how good the movies actually are, but they're often preppy independent films with too open of interpretations.

  
Literally two weeks ago, I saw Nosferatu in theaters and it was good, so many exceptions exist."
Yeah in Kickass he damages his nerve endings giving him reduced perceived damage
Did you get to glean any of Michael B. Jordan's greatness?
That’s so awesome! Thanks for sharing that. I can’t wait to see it!
That’s awesome man 🔥🔥🔥💯
"That’s great to hear 

How did you get into the movie"
That movie was so much worse than Death on the orient express.. She could have been nudes the entire film it and would still be forgettable.
She had the charisma of a Woden spoon my man
"She has no range, no trial, no nothing. Straight to jail"
what's off with the superman casting?
"I did not know she was cast as Superman, but okay then. 

That being said, I agree with u/Groot746, Gadot has no acting talent and no real charisma. She was okay in the first Wonderwoman, because the movie was in general good, but... just nah for her getting all these roles."
How are the Superman castings off? The casting for that movie looks great
"Also as in the ""the most fair"". She is kind and gives chances to all creatures, from the forest animals, to the exiled dwarves, to even the old lady who randomly shows up at her door.

Will never get on board with the remake though."
"And with Armie Hammer, no less...!"
We are here for you Joe. Collectively we are all here for u!
"Same here.


Boy, that film was a stinker."
"I still wanna know who owed who a favor that led to that movie being made. It has ""we had a 5-picture deal and you owe me one more"" energy."
"I just watched that movie last night.  Lots of weird choices, but one of the weirdest was not using known dinosaurs.  They just straight up invented new creatures.  What?  They couldn't get the rights to Allosaurus or something?"
"Dinosaur kid as well. Grew up on the original three movies, was just old enough to remember when TLW released in 1997. Own and have read both Crichton novels.

Love all six films, but you know, different strokes for different folks."
"This is basically a soft reboot with a different director and a different cast. I didn't like JW 2 and JW3, but I'm cautiously optimistic about this one. I really like Gareth Edwards's Godzilla 2014"
"You care enough to wish their death lol. I was just giving my opinion too about their existence. If you don’t like it,move on."
Yeah that too. It’s very different from Moon.
I mean there is no sort of he unambiguously made major successes with guardians. They are three incredibly popular well liked movies even if I’m not a huge fan of them personally
"So many exceptions exist that it doesn't really make sense to say to begin with, I'd argue.  I mean, I'm not trying to insult you or tear you down, I just don't think it makes any sense at all, that one particular statement.

*Casablanca, Chinatown, Fargo, Platoon, Seven, Goodfellas, Jaws, Heat, Rashomon, Metropolis, Manhattan, Notorious, Memento, Network, Scarface, Vertigo, Deliverance, Brazil, Magnolia, Psycho, Alien, Aliens, Babe, Clue, Ratatouille*...I mean, I could legit go on for a *long, long time* listing not only good but great/classic movies that have one-word titles."
He mostly kept mumbling about Wakanda and ‘the colonizers’
"People i knew were core crew and got me on as an additional early on. I ended up staying on the rest of the production, almost two months!"
Kal el .. noooo
Proving his point
I read that as wuhan spoon
"The Rock too, and yet I don't see you people clamouring for banning him from Hollywood."
"I thought it was overblown but unless she was phoning it in she was really bad in the second wonder woman and her little bit in the flash was also horrendous.

Now admittedly the flash wasn't very good in general but most of the other actors were still ok"
I swear Rachel Brosnahan was born to play Lois Lane.
"I agree for the most part. Corenswet just strikes me as the George Clooney Batman of Supermans. Looks good as Clark, but not quite right as Superman. Like Superman’s little brother put the suit on. "
Very much felt like a COVID movie.  Only 4 characters.  Hardly ever see that these days.
"I knew something was wrong immediately. 

“65 billion years before the advent of humanity.”
Immediately shows a human person.

I was very nervous that his name was going to be Adam and that he would found humanity on earth"
not all 3 are well received and if we are being honest they aren't great.
"Well... let me break it down even further...

I was really meaning one-word titles with an ordinary word like ""Sudden""."
Love to see it
I've seen plenty of people complaining about him. You probably would have in this post if he were in any of the movies in the article.
"Ya she’s gonna absolutely crush it, perfect pick for the role"
He's bigger than Cavill.
"Oh boy the dominating and evil takes of Supes over the years have skewed the views of the people to what or who Superman is, is insane lol"
"Every single movie in the trilogy has above 80 per cent both audience and critic score on rotten tomatoes. I have no idea what your metric is if that’s not very well received. 

To be clear if you dislike them or don’t think they are good that’s fine. But you are in the extreme minority"
"*Ohhhhh*, I think I understand what you are saying better now lol"
"I've seen it too, but not to the level people whine about Gal Gadot when they're about as bad as each other."
"Taller I think, but I wouldn’t say he’s bigger. And that’s not necessarily what I’m referring to. It just looks off to me. Sorry to all the people riding Gunn’s nuts. It still looks well done from what little I’ve seen… I just think Superman looks off. "
I'm lost. what's the plot?
"Something like ""Sinners"" is so generic, it could describe a plethora of movies. They couldn't have come up with a more unique name to describe the movie"
"honestly, I worked on it and i think the title is fitting. yeah it's generic but it's also not giving anything away about the movie. if anything, it's clever misdirection because I'm pretty sure I'm know what you think the movie is. because that's what I thought it was too until I actually read the script. it's just Ryan Cooglar's take and style in this specific, familiar genre."
"I don't necessarily agree that one name titles are indictive of a bad movie, but I think they still somewhat have a point. I wasn't calling out Sinners either, it just happened to be the first generic movie name in the title. Already being an established director like Cooglar helps."
Dune 2 in IMAX
Mad Max: Fury Road.
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
"For me, the most recent was Across the Spiderverse. 

That part where Gwen is having the confrontation with her dad where the whole world bleeds into watercolors? Truly astounding. One of the most visually striking pieces of animation that I've ever witnessed, and seeing it on a big screen really magnified the magic. I sat there with my jaw agape for the whole 5 minutes of that scene."
F1 just did
Top Gun : Maverick
The Wild Robot!
Nosferatu
"Dungeons and dragons. Saw it on an iSense screen and it was a wild ride, far better than I was expecting"
Rogue One
Nice try Nicole Kidman.
Mission impossible was sick. The submarine scene specifically made me feel like i was back in the prime time cinema days
"Endgame. It was a shared a experience in that whole theater seeing Spider-Man, Cap with Mjolnir, etc."
Sinners
"*The Substance*. Around the New Years show scene I was looking around the theater thinking ""I can't believe this is on screen in a major release"". This was before the best picture nom"
Honestly? Dungeons and Dragons: Among Thieves. That movie is so fun
"Oddly, Wicked. Amazing sets and musical pieces with choreography. Before that, Babylon"
The Lord of the Rings movies were the last for me.  I could see Dune being a proper answer as well but I didn't get to them in the theater unfortunately.
"My favourite movie is fantastic Mr Fox and they showed it at my local cinema on my birthday, I actually nearly cried. Also we went to see everything everywhere all at once for the 2nd time when it was rereleased after it won an Oscar so it was packed out, proper cinema experience"
Jurassic Park - 1993
Superman
"I have thoroughly enjoyed so many movies over the last couple years. But I think the last time I literally sat in silent bliss as the credits rolled was The Batman. Batman has been dark, campy, badass, but *this* Batman was my vibe, and they nailed it."
Godzilla Minus One
F1 most recently ~ great movie
Oppenheimer
"Furiosa. I personally thought it was just as good as Fury Road, it was just telling a different story in a different way. More introspective and emotionally resonant, more mythic and epic in scope compared to the visceral immediacy of its predecessor. 

It was criminal how poorly this fared at the box office."
Godzilla Minus One
"Godzilla 2014. At the end, he just gets up, lumbers back out to sea to a jubilant score while the news crawl goes ""GODZILLA: SAVIOR OF SAN FRANCISCO"" and it gave me a bit of that rush, if at least a tickle of the kind you don't get watching at home"
F1 last week. But I love F1 so I might be biased lol but that was a really fun movie
"Honestly?
The fellowship of the ring. It was something I can't even imagine how to describe."
Once upon a time in Hollywood
Nosferatu
"The Batman. First movie I saw in the theater since before COVID and last movie since. While not perfect, I enjoyed myself quite a bit."
"I know it’s recency bias, but Superman. It took me back to the times us Gen Xers had him and Batman for our only superhero movies. Those franchises were events, and there are several times I found myself smiling like I did back when my mom dropped me off at the theater with a $5 bill. I’m reflective today, it’s my birthday, get off my lawn"
"Endgame, for sure. I'll be chasing that high for the rest of my life. The culmination of a decade+. The Return of the King. That was an event. Most recently though was Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning. You have to experience those in theater. That was cinema joy to me."
"A big bucket of extra buttered popcorn and a large soft drink makes me feel the good old cinema magic, not the movie itself..."

"i dont go to movies much anymore, but the last one that made be feel pure 100% awe was dune 2 in imax. phenomenal film"

Godzilla 2014! When he charged that breath up the entire they started cheering!!
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Saw it 3 times in theatres. Love that movie.
POOR THINGS
Interstellar. 
The Wild Robot. One of the best movies I've ever seen and I consider myself insanely lucky I could see it on the big screen~
Hmm probably the two dune movies/ esp the opening 20 minutes of Dune 2: Dunier.
"Most recently, I thought Nosferatu was stunning, looks-wise. I can't believe it didn't win any Oscars."
The whole “on your left” opener from *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* that culminates in one of the oldest trick shots in movies. As soon as I saw that I knew the film was in good hands. And it’s like a minute into the movie.
"The latest Mission Impossible film was sooo good. I think the projectionist was a bit deaf too because he had slammed the volume up to max and turned the subwoofers up to 11, a true theatre shaking spectacle."
Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
The Lighthouse
Sinners
Killers of the flower moon
The Life Of Chuck
American Beauty- girlfriend wanted to go. I knew nothing about it. At the time just locked me in with the story and camera work.
"Thunderbolts* - I did watch Sinners in theaters and liked it a lot, but Thunderbolts gave me Summer Movie vibes, and it’s been a while since I’ve had that, and it did come out after Sinners.."
Pretty recent - but Superman! The sound particularly was something that needed to be experienced in a cinema.
"Armageddon. The whole world came together to pray for ten men just wanting to get home to their everything. Huge cast and visuals even though the critics were harsh, everyone felt that minute Harry said goodbye to Grace."
Damn. I cant even remmber. Thank you actually. Need to go soon again.
"I watched Princess Mononoke for the first time, last year, during Ghiblifest and it was amazing. I can almost feel the same exhilaration I felt, just by thinking about that movie. It became my favorite Studio Ghibli film after that."
Haven’t had an extremely moving movie experience  since Parasite
call me crazy but the minecraft movie got the magic
"For the full theater experience? Definitely Sonic 3. The crowd was electric seeing that one in a packed theater. I expect Superman to feel similar this weekend, honestly.

Otherwise? Let me tell you, seeing The Substance in an empty theater was an EXPERIENCE."
"For me it was The Marvels. Definitely a ""this made coming to the theater 100% worth it"" vs ""I could have just watched this at home

The bar is getting raised higher and higher because audiences are getting worse and worse, and also less emotional: It's very uncomfortable to be balling over a sad scene in a movie and no one else seems affected at ALL. That was my experience with The Boy And The Heron which was beautiful but I SHOULD HAVE WATCHED IT AT HOME.  

With The Marvels the audience was actually fully engaged, laughing at funny parts, acting afraid at tense parts. And the visual effects/sound was well worth it. 

Going to Superman tomorrow so fingers crossed 🤞🏾"
The Brutalist in 70mm
Dune 2.  The sound effects and MUSIC hit me in my goddamn chest.  It was a movie you NEEDED to see in a theater.

The OG Jurassic Park score in the new ScarJo movie. Goosebumps all around motherfuckers.
"This is why I love going to movies with my girlfriend. I almost always feel that spark. Some recent(ish) movies that really got me tho are Across the Spiderverse, IF, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, Dune 2, Sinners, and Superman!"
Top Gun Maverick !!!! A movie that needs to be watched in cinema. Such a great watch
"Nosferatu

I had forgotten how GOOD movies look when they are well made and on the big screen. Seeing snow falling across the scene on a 30 foot canvas in high definition was a seriously amazing thing. Such a dark movie cannot be done justice on a streaming bitrate and a home TV, even a good one."

When the ship was tilting and the man hit the propeller? Epic"
The Substance. So glad I caught that in theaters. It was a wild ride.
"Dune 1/2.

Saw both on streaming originally but I had the option to see D2 on the big screen so I thought why not.

Enjoyed that so much I immediately went to a double showing of both a week later at my local Cinema."

Honestly? F1. It really felt like a good old summer blockbuster. Even the soundtrack and music videos gave that old blockbuster feel.
The Brutalist - incredible cinematography
It was very recently as previous movies hadn’t done it. F1.
Oppenheimer
Gravity
Elio
Nosferatu. The atmosphere alone felt gripping and heart pounding with ever scene Count Orlock was in. 
"Blair Witch Project

I remember walking out wondering, ""That was a movie...right?"" Everyone outside was eerily quiet. I saw people with the same stupefied look I probably had on my face. One dude was hugging his girlfriend trying to comfort her. And I saw a few other people crying. 

I doubt that'll ever be recreated."
"More recently, F1 the Movie"
Top Gun: Maverick in IMAX
"Honestly? It's the movies that aren't blockbusters. It's the quiet human moments on screen that just pull you in.

Lee, with Kate Winslet, had some of that quiet weight. Fantastic film."
Last Showgirl
Life of Chuck
Oppenheimer in IMAX. $hit was loud af it was hard not to be immersed
Triangle of Sadness
"In terms of real magic?  The Great and Powerful Oz. 

Watched it in 3D and whoever’s decision to reduce the amount of screen used for the scene where it was snowing deserves a massive raise. It really made it seem like snow was coming out of the screen."
"Probably Sinners, which was I think the most recent movie I saw after Life of Chuck (which was still pretty dang good, don't get me wrong)."
Twisters was really cool in theatre. The surround sound made it feel like I was also in a tornado.
The Fall Guy
The new Mission Impossible!
Original Saw
F1 in imax.
"Mission impossible: Dead Reckoning in the true-blue imax theater in King of Prussia. The sound alone was absolutely bombastic, great film as well. The Rome car chase was my second favorite theater moment ever."
"28 years later most recently, and also actually enjoyed the new Jurassic Park as well, much better than the last couple were."

"I went to see Princess Mononoke when they did the IMAX remaster release.

It was just amazing to see."
So good of him to take time off the Rocky Horror Picture Show to get married.
Sinners
"F1. Hear me out. I haven’t seen a good ol’ adrenaline movie in theaters in years but F1 The Movie did this. It was me and my best friend who just moved back and hadn’t seen him in two years. We both like F1 and I was genuinely excited just to see a movie with him like the good old days. Maybe it was the movie, maybe it was just seeing a movie with my best friend but it felt like a full on cinema experience."
Last movie I saw in a movie palace was The Incredibly Somebody with Jude Law and Gweneth Paltrow
Avengers: Endgame. The shared experience was really enjoyable.

"Sinners. So many reasons, the music, cinematography, the humor, the visual effects, where to start? I’ll pick one - the COLOR. It had a PALETTE. Every scene POPPED with colorful detail, especially the costumes. After so much comic book grey and brown my eyes hurt from all the color."
"The final 20 minutes of Wicked were electrifying for me. That music, the visuals. Teared me up for sure"
F1 in IMAX.
Mission Impossible Final Reckoning
F1 in imax
Spider-Man No Way Home
Grand Budapest Hotel.
"Alien: Romulus.

Dune 2 before that."
"I was totally immersed in the new Jurassic Park Rebirth movie, probably because it leaned more heavily into the horror aspects of the story.  The opening laboratory sequence was visually stunning and the sequences on the boats were a great new addition to the franchise."
"Godzilla Minus One

Expected rampaging monster kaiju nonsense. Found myself deeply worried for the safety of my characters all the way until the last frame. Terrifying wonder throughout. Watched it again in the theater a few weeks later. Black and white is the best version."
"F1 was pretty great, a little thin on plot, but some great visuals and man old Brad Pitt sure did win the genetic lottery.  This goes back a aways, but I really enjoyed Kid Detective.  It really got me invested in the character and story.    Second Hand Lions is another one I saw in the theater that really got me invested.  I also saw ""The Life Of Chuck"" last weekend, that was pretty great as well."
28 years later! sweeping cinematic landscapes and a engrossing soundtrack that haunts you
"Everything Everywhere All At Once, can't believe it hasn't been mentioned yet."
Transformers One
Karate Kid Legends was nice. 
Sinners
"This is kind of an odd answer, but Bring Her Back is first that popped into mind for me. Ive thought really hard about this and I don’t think I can remember any other movie I’ve seen in theaters that had the audience physically and verbally react so strongly to the most intense moments. That aspect of it really reminded me of the magic of going to the cinema."
28 Years Later
Sinners.
"For a movie I hadn’t seen up till that point? Endgame on opening night, it was the culmination of like 11 years of story coming to an end and it was so epic and ceremonious I don’t think anything will top that.

As for a movie I had already seen but got to see in the theater? Jurassic Park. It’s one of if not my all time favorite movies and being 28 I never got to see it in theaters but finally got to see it during Covid in a completely empty theater and it was incredible. Talk about a movie that was made for the big screen."
The Revenant
"No Time to Die

My wife hated it so much, she decided to give me a blow job in the middle of the theatre. We were in the back row of a mostly empty VIP theatre. 

It was incredible."
F1!
La la land. Watched a ton of great movies in theater since. But La la land was magical. It isn’t even a genre I am particularly interested in.
Oppenheimer
Just saw the live version of How To Train Your Dragon last week. I actually really loved it and think its a better experience in the theater.
"Once upon a time in Hollywood, with the intermission. Was so nice to have a pause! Wish more movies did this."
Back to the future 2 in 70 mm. I wish I could relive it again and again. It came to my city a few years back.
Sinners
"Everything Everywhere All At Once. 

My experience fits your description perfectly. I went in blind, was blown away by what I saw on screen. Bonus points because I heard the effects team for that movie was quite small."
Avengers Endgame. The culmination of 10 years and audience reactions in the final act were incredible. I hadn’t soaked in that kind of fan love since the Star Wars special editions in the late 90s.

"Definitely the Dune movies.

But honestly Star Wars The Force Awakens (episode 7) felt pretty magical at the time despite all the criticism that trilogy receives. I felt like young boy again, all that childlike wonder and amazement came back."

Blue Jasmine really worked me over.
Last year after seeing Dune Part 2 and Wicked. And this year seeing Princess Mononoke in IMAX. Those kinds of movies make me remember why I love watching movies.
Wicked IMAX Universal City opening weekend
Probably the first Avatar. Went to see it 4 more times.
Dune 2 and Bad Boys 4 for some reason. Really gave me back my passion for theaters after a long streak of bad films.
"Top Gun: Maverick. Someone else already said it and I upvoted, but saying it again. Tom Cruise has an absolute love of the craft and it comes through in all of his movies."
"I mean, Avengers: Endgame was epic. So was Top Gun: Maverik, and Dune. 

This may be a weird opinion, but Dream Scenario with Nick Cage was one that recently inspired me to think outside the box as a filmmaker. It’s weird and trippy, the ending was kinda confusing, but I really liked my experience with it."
"28 Years Later is Danny Boyle showing off his cinematic skills. He’s a helluva filmmaker.

also from this year, the delightful The Life Of Chuck. It’s got some magical scenes for sure."
"Not normally into stuff like this one, but by the final scenes it really made an impact, had a vision and voice as well as something powerful to say. It gave me goosebumps - a bit of truly elevated cinema told through one of the most unreliable narrators there is  (though I'm not sure I would seek it out for a rewatch). Part of me wonders if they intentionally bungled the sequel. IDK. Anywho I'm thinking of JOKER"
Life Of Chuck
La La Land
"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish

For real reals, that movie had no reason to be as good as it was."
Paul Blart: Mall Cop
The climax of Challengers got me good
"Spielberg's West Side Story. I've seen a lot of movies since but that stands out to me as pure cinema. The colors, the shapes, the camera movements, the effortless mise-en-scene."
Finding Nemo... but then I'm old and it reminded me of the old Disney films
"THE LIFE OF CHUCK.  The drumming scene, as well as the dancing in the kitchen scene."
Sinners was only like last month and it blew my fucking mind. Haven't seen something like that in years.
"*Sonic the Hedgehog 3*. When ""Live and Learn"" started playing, I was squealing and kicking my feet."
Sinners
"Not seeing any shoutouts for horror.

Get Out and Paranormal Activty were standout experiences for me.

When the audience is into it, you can feel the tension across the whole theater, and it adds so much."
Sinners
"as recently as Sinners and Thunderbolts.  
My buddy and I did a double feature.

The generational music scene in Sinners literally had me choked up. It was just magical. One of the coolest things I've seen in a movie. And Thunderbolts was just the icing on the cake, that whole movie is a blast as well. I wanted to see it again the moment it was over."
Dunkirk. Before that Gravity.
Sinners
"Tonight I saw the new Jurassic Park, and that was a fantastic theater experience. I'll probably watch it again in 4DX, but tonight's viewing felt just like a time machine back to my childhood. I also must say, I haven't been to a movie theater since 2019. Amazing film to be welcomed back with."
The Fall Guy
"28 Years Later. 

I don't care if its not your genre or you don't like the plot or the ending. The whole sequence throughout much of the beginning of the film is so trippy and anxiety inducing while showing you themes and deeper meaning not explained explicitly. 

Then you have shots in the movie that are just wildly beautiful in such a terrifying setting. The night time wide shot of the causeway is one of the most beautiful images I have seen in a long time. Starlight, water, tiny figures dashing across water, deep purples and blues. It was breath taking. There are several other shots like that in the movie. That's not even getting into how awesome I thought it was and how deeply this movie touched me at my core about loss and grieving and sickness and humanity and just everything. I loved it

It was made even better that like a month earlier I had just seen Sinners in theaters and it blew me away too! 2025 is a great year for movie going. Sinners is going down in movie making history. I was so worried about the change up that I just didn't want them to change it over because I was so invested in the characters I thought monsters would ruin it. What a great movie."
"I just watched Mission Impossible today.

It was okay, but as a movie, it was almost anachronistic. I was saying to someone that it stood out how different it was from what I've noticed recently, where you can sort of tell that a lot of movies are written, edited, and shot to be watched either on a phone or while you're disinterestedly scrolling Insta on your couch. Just the way that characters talk about what they're doing and the shot composition. Whereas this movie had scenes of dialogue explaining what was going on and why it was important, and then a full-on action scene, the type of which, if you looked away from the screen for 30 seconds, you would look back and be completely confused as to what was going on. It demanded your attention."
"End Game.

""Avengers!........ Assemble..."""
"So there is an independent theater here that plays an eclectic mix of new, arthouse, cult and classic movies. They showed the Indian action film [RRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_vbAtFSEc0) when it opened back in 2022 and it was such a crowd hit that they still do a showing of it once a month. My friend loves that movie and finally convinced me to go. Not only is the movie itself wild, but the fans are insane. When they introduce each hero and when the big action set pieced happen the crowd goes nuts."
Nosferatu
Sinners
Strange Darling
Furiosa
Avatar 1.
"Since Mad Max has already mentioned, I will say the Batman (Pattinson one).

Nice slow paced film that pulls you into the mystery that Batman/Bruce is trying to solve."
"Alien Romulus was rad, I thought those kids acted there asses off. Great visuals too, had a blast in the theatre"
The Northman.
Sinners.
"Flow. Anxiously awaiting the 4K release, but *man* seeing it at The Angelica was a spellbinding experience."
I feel it all the time. I'll say seeing Michael B Jordan pass himself a cigarette in Sinners in IMAX 70mm is one of the more recent ones.
La La Land
"Final Destination, it makes me imagine what it would have been like to watch Faces of Death in the theater"
Probably The Force Awakens
2012. There was a standing ovation at the end.
1917
"How To Train Your Dragon - the remake.

For being a remake of an animated flick, it still managed to preserve the heart and soul of the original movie. Plus, it didn't hurt having John Powell come back to score the movie - that Test Drive scene was just as glorious, if not better than the OG.

They filmed this movie for IMAX so if your cinema is showing it, I would absolutely watch it again on a big-ass screen and 7.1 surround sound."
"Last night - F1 in Imax

That + Sinners are probably gonna be the highlights for 2025 for me."
Top Gun Maverick
"Life of Chuck, excellent!"
Sinners ✨
Top gun 2
🤔….. been so long I can’t remember. Too damn expensive nowadays anyway.
Top Gun Maverick for me
Wicked.
"Anora.

Sean Baker is my favorite director and it was my first time seeing one of his movies in a theater.

But I also felt it during Barbie, Oppenheimer, Top Gun Maverick, The Substance, everything everywhere all at once, and Nosferatu."
28 years later!
Dune. Both
Deadpool and Wolverine in 4DX. The opening scene with the moving chairs and the water spray was very fun.
"Ford vs Ferrari at an IMAX.

Stunning visuals and audio, great performances by Damon and Bale, with excellent support too from actors like Balfe."
Probably the Way of Water
"F1 imax, has all the 80s-90s feels and is an amazing technical production"
F1
Sinners
Apollo 11. Seeing that beautifully restored footage on the big screen was amazing. It was better than almost any blockbuster I’ve ever watched.
"Blade Runner 2049

Every scene felt important and crafted meticulously. The movie was 3 hours long and by the end I didnt want it to be over."
"The greatest showman. Everything about that experience in the cinema. 
Jaws, re-watching it on the big screen made it even more magic."
Batman - the Robert Pattinson one
"Barbie and Oppenheimer was something special
. I had just gotten laid off after ten years at my job, and the same weekend me and my wife saw both in theaters and after barbie I immediately knew everything would be alright."
Nosferatu
M:I The Final Reckoning  and F1
Alien: Romulus
Nosferatu. Great atmosphere and beautiful images.
Mad Max: Furiosa
Dune 2
"If you mean theatres specifically probably Avatar as that's one of the last-ish movies I've seen in theatres. Yes, I know the story is pocahontas but still it was very enjoyable and well done world building."
Top Gun: Maverick
#Dune 2
"Definitely Paddington 2, it had me weeping like a fool."
Kantara. A Kannada movie. I was entranced by the end.
"The F1 movie is pretty good in IMAX, as was Mission Impossible . All the money was on the screen. I'm picking and choosing films I see at the cinema and ones I'll watch at home. IMAX makes a huge difference."
"Sinners for me! I’ve never been so close to standing up and clapping as I was at the music through the eras scene. Just incredible. 

Before that, it was Everything Everywhere All At Once. Saw it in the standard format and IMAX and both times it blew my mind."
"The Geidi Prime segment was truly awe-inspiring. The black sun, the infrared shift as they move from inside to outside, the “ink” fireworks. That whole section of the movie had me entirely immersed."
Both Dune movies in IMAX 70mm for sure. I was in awe
there were so many moments in the theater where i quietly laughed to myself because i couldn’t believe what i was seeing/feeling. it was all so masterful that i felt true love for cinema. that geidi prime sequence is one example
"After seeing Dune 2 in IMAX, I came home and told my wife I'd just seen the greatest movie of all time. What I realize now is that I'd seen one of the greatest theatrical experiences of all time."
That worm ride scene in imax left me drooling lol I was so stunned.
The visuals were amazing but think especially the audio would not have come through like it did if I would have watched it at home.
"Dune 2 in Dolby Cinema

Edit: I originally said Dolby Digital but am correcting to clarify it’s Dolby Cinema, which is much different…"
"My seat was shaking with the audio. I was in awe the entire time. Walked out in a bit of a daze. Then I watched it at home and was just kinda “meh” about it. That said, will be at the theater for 3."
I was in Florida for a conference and saw it on Dolby Digital in Disney Springs...one of my favorite movies going experiences ever
I wish I could watch this movie for the first time again
definitely made me feel all shiny and chrome
100%. Whole theatre left like we’d just seen something special.
"Great answer,  im pretty sure I saw this in theaters about 4 times."
This on IMAX with the volume on 11 was an amazing experience! Afterwards energy wise felt like I had been to a metal concert or something.
"My wife and I saw this movie four times in the theater. That’s the record for us, with The Dark Knight coming in second at three viewings."
"The score, the sounds, the visuals, I was just laughing at how  incredible it was. Amazing experience"
"I was gonna say Paddington in Peru.... But this works, too."
Haven't seen this movie yet lol. Might watch it
I came out of the cinema and went straight to buy the soundtrack….
YES
Straight up
Bingo. This is the last movie I watched in theaters and then went back and watched again the same day.
"Oh my god! Another Fury Road fanatic!

I saw this in the theatre and it instantly entered my top 5. The movie was a treat to watch, visually and aurally."
"Yup, came here to say Fury Road too."
That was such a blast! I was pushed into my seat the whole movie. What a thrilling piece of media that movie is and I never watched it again outside of a cinema because I felt it was a disservice to that first experience.
I purposely went into this movie not knowing a single thing about it. Once I figured out what it was going to be about partway through the movie I about lost my shit. I then spent the rest of the time trying to figure out where Tarantino was gonna take it… Historically accurate or revisionist? The outcome was absolutely fucking fantastic. What a great ride! So glad I went into it blind.
This one was a glorious theatre experience indeed. Had a broken leg too.
The entire world becomes watercolors and the color pallet changes between each shot. It's really hard to fully convey how beautiful that scene is.
"I try to convey to anyone who'd bear me how refreshing to see a CGI animation finally try to embrace the limitless possibilities of expression to tell a visual story.... But I get blank stares.  Spider verse films are fantastic, and i don't even like the spiderman franchise."
"Back when Into The Spiderverse was in theaters, I would tell people that it was a work of art and they would laugh at me.  I didn't care because I was so enchanted with that movie, especially on the big screen.  Across is good, but Into was a true original."
"I still remember gasping audibly after Gwen is handed the gizmo as her dad is trapped in a forcefield. Holding my breath from when the opening credits went glitch-crazy over Columbia. From the first 10 seconds onwards, my arm hair was raised as well as my eyelids. The whole movie felt like half an hour. And I saw the 'less on the nose' cut first. Was spun out when I saw it a second time and it was edited differently. But that made the experience even more thrilling. Multiple interpretations of the one story to suit the multiverse/spider verse movie."
For me what really felt like “the movies” for me was that I didn’t expect the way it ended. Maybe it’s how people felt when The Empire Strikes Back came out
"Omg that moment....yes

Remember before I saw it like seeing Hailee Steinfeld say it looked like a mood ring....

Yes ....just....yes."
YES DUDE. I'm so glad to see someone who loves that scene as much as I do. I want to get like a giant print of it and frame it in my house
I wish I saw this in theaters. A beautiful movie and so ambitious from a visual standpoint.
Hard agree. F1 was the first movie in a long time that really made me lose myself into the cinematography
"Yep F1 and top gun Maverick are the best ones in the last 5 + years. Must see films in the movie theater, it's an entire experience. And that's how movies should be in my opinion. Appropriately they have the same director."
"This and the new How To Train Your Dragon.

It’s been a great summer for those of us that still go to the movies."
It's such a thrilling experience. I really want to see it again before it leaves theaters.
The f1 theme is the tits too!
This one for sure.
You’ve got to see this one in a theater. 
This one 100%. And before that? Nothing sticks out in the past 10 years (although there are a few I wish I'd caught in theatres).
Tom Cruise has some wacky religious views but hot damn he makes a good movie. The latest (last) Mission Impossible movie was my favorite action film that I’ve seen in years.
F1: The Movie ! Highly recommend if you like that style of storytelling.
"Not seeing it in theaters is my biggest regret when it comes to not seeing a movie in theaters. With how good it was at home on my TV , I knew I missed out on something special"
Best movie I've ever seen in theaters. Maverick's canyon run was like crack.
Saw this in a 4DX cinema after the Covid lockdown. It worked so well with the movement of the chairs and the fans- even the water sprays for the sailing scenes. Amazing experience.
"I never see movies multiple times in a theater.  I’m usually not ready for a rewatch that soon. 

I saw Top Gun: Maverik three times and each experience was different.  First in a regular theater (it was all we could get), second time in a Cinemark XD, and the last at a Regal ScreenX with the extra screens on both sides for the panoramic view during some scenes."
"That’s what I was gonna say! 🛩️
Before that … Avatar (the original)"
Watched it on a plane on an iPad. I failed you all (and Tom).
"Honestly, I went in with ridiculously low expectations. Maverick blew me away."
I saw this at home and was standing inches from my tv for certain parts. I count that as cinema magic
first quality movie post-pandemic
"Yeah, this is it. Saw it three times in theaters."
"I went into this excited, but it exceeded my expectations so much. I knew that Tom Cruise went for a ride in the F-18s but I thought that it was going to be just for a few shots like the carrier takeoff. Then, sitting there in the theater, I realized the whole cast went up in the air to shoot several scenes. Absolutely amazing spectacle!"
The 5-year anniversary showings will be in 2027!
"This is my answer. I loved Dune Part Two, Godzilla Minus One, Oppenheimer, etc but Top Gun: Maverick was such a thrilling experience. Deadpool & Wolverine is a close 2nd."
"me too!  visually stunning, and it made me laugh, tear up, and feel like it was so worth it to watch on the big screen"
"I was so bothered by the fact that I was NOT moved by this, even though I was clearly supposed to be. My companion felt the same."
Every single frame of that movie looked like a painting. Glad I saw it on the big screen.
Sinners brought the A game too. Vampire movies are having a thing now.
I love dogs but had an odd irrational fear of the Counts dogs and when they were chasing Holtz I felt like I was going to have a mini panic attack.
It was so beautiful.
"I was so pleasantly surprised by that movie. Went in expecting a B tier marvel style popcorn movie.
I wish they'd make some more DnD movies in that style. It doesn't have to be the same characters just seems like a great setting and tone for some more adventures."
"Absolutely.. I wasn't skeptical watching the trailer but the movie was amazingly refreshing and hilarious.

Was suffering from marvel fatigue"
Underrated comment.
"Yes, came here to say this exact scene. I was on the edge of my seat."
when tom spins the airlock valve and the aspect ratio opens up to imax. thats fucking movie magic baby
"This was mine as well, probably the only time I will ever be totally on board with a loud audience which I usually abhor. 

Everyone screaming when cap picked up Mjolnir was 100% earned."
"Yep. It was like this generations Jurassic Park or Jaws. Everyone stopped what they were doing to join. Dad took off work, jimmy skipped school, mom canceled her appointment, they dug grandmas rotting corpse out of the grave. Everyone went and joined in and talked about it for weeks"
"April 22, 2019. I have been chasing that high ever since."
"Definitely agree with the shared experience vibe. I live in NYC, so the giant IMAX theater at Lincoln Square is pretty accessible for me. My second Endgame viewing was a 3am showing over opening weekend that was sold out. I got a ticket just for that unique showtime experience. The crowd was so hyped even in the middle of the night, and we all exited the theater as the sun was rising. Surreal and special experience."
I remember trying to avoid spoilers for that in my senior year of high school. Saw it after graduating.
"Never saw the trailer and I went blind. My brother who usually has good taste begged me to see it. He is like “dude I know you man. 3 things interest you more then anything History, music, and the spooky and mysterious corners of the Deep South. this movie is right up your alley!”

And he was correct"
That scene with the ancestors about midway through... never seen anything like it.
"Oh yeah. Almost forgot about that one. The specific scene that transcends the movie, music and art itself is very on point for this thread. It did felt like movie magic."
Yes! I saw it twice at the theater and I can't remember the last movie that made me do that. Maybe Titanic?
This is a great iykyk pick
"I was hyped from the first trailer and thoroughly enjoyed a new and interesting take on vampires and a look at the world through African-American perspectives in the time period. Fuck the haters, this movie is fantastic."
"WARNING SPOILERS :I  really loved how the last scene of the film put everything into context! The immortal vampire couple that looked like they walked directly out of 1992 and into the bar. To reunite with the only sole survivor of the vampire massacre, the young blues player who has now aged 60 years later! I love how he tells either Smokes or Stacks( I can't remember which one it was but not the one with the inscence woman and baby but the other one)! once I week I wake up and remember that day! Then Michael B. Jordan says His lines about his brother and the sun setting for the last time! This film was better than I thought it was going to be and it definitely should be nominated for some awards! Delray Lindo was great has the drunk blues musician!"
"Came here to say this! I was so glad I got to see it with an audience because the reactions added to the experience immensely! Everyone was fully into it and the gasps, giggles, and occasional “oh no” were awesome. And when it went all Troma at the end? Magic."
"My god, that movie looked so shitty from it’s trailers and promos. It looked like a Disney Channel movie.

But man, that movie was a great time."
Jarnathan!
"Strongly agreed. I think what really captures that 'magic' feeling for me is that the movie isn't epic. Like so many movies (both bad and amazing) these days try to be an epic saga where everything is grand and dramatic.

The D&D movie was just several adventurers going on a romp. Like yeah it still had world-ending stakes, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and really captured that fun film vibe that makes cinema so great."
I was watching Wicked at home and thought “oh damn this is a MOVIE movie.”  Pleasantly surprised
">Wicked

This is a good one. I feel like it's the movie I've most gotten lost in while watching in some time."
Yes! This was great in the theater. Felt so much bigger than watching at home.
yes im ready for the 4 hour marathon in the theatre when for good comes out
100%. Last night was an amazing time at the movies.
"I agree, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of his achievement and his persecution."
Agreed! I feel like such an outcast when I tell people I liked Furiosa better than Fury Road
Absolutely agree. Man that was a great time in the cinema. Saw it in a packed session and everyone was just totally on board for some old school style Godzilla mayhem.
F1 is my answer and I don't think I've ever even seen a clip of an F1 race so I'm not biased.  It's a fantastic movie. 
"I had A-list when this movie came out and saw it five times in Dolby (that's, like, over 15 hours of my life, lol). God, the SOUND was otherwordly."
Fantastic movie!
"I was stuck somewhere on the east coast with a long flight delay.  So I went to the theater and saw it.  I think I was the only one in the theater, man it so much fun."
Saw it in 3D in my VR headset last month. Twas great. The giant robot pounding on kaijus never really gets old but this fresh perspective was on point.
"I felt the same, pretty unfair all the hate it's getting IMO. Sure it had a few quirks, but for me it had way more fun and depth than what I was expecting. "
"Was going to say this

There was something about it that made me sit up and then when the movie ended I was back to reality

Almost had to google that it wasn't a documentary it drew me in so well"
"I don't get this feeling from every movie, but I definitely got it from 28 years later. Incredible film."
"Came here to say 28 Years. 

Everyone I know that's seen it all agree it's probably the first real movie to come out in a long time. 

Just such a high level of handcraft put into it. From the story to the acting to the music. Hell, the cinematography ALONE was some of the best I've seen in a long long while."
"Oh man, I'd love to see this on a big screen"
"Still a great film, for those who can disassociate themselves from reality and fantasy."
"Oh man, I was blown away by Armageddon when I saw it in theaters"
"For me it was the scene where Baron Harkonen was sitting, floating, on arrakis and the emperor’s silver orb of a ship flies over.   [literally the last 2 seconds of this scene](https://youtu.be/tmWQ7cpAiAw?si=ph5eWfFpqDtQySP0)

I don’t know why, but that image (and really the whole arrival of the emperor) were somehow amazing to me."
"I have a pretty good home setup and that scene at home just doesn’t even come close to watching it at the laser IMAX theater. Even in HDR. It felt infrared at the theater and I remember just being astounded at the way it looked. When it was finally released we watched it at home and the scene just feels black and white, not anywhere close to the theater!"
"You and me both. I've been watching folks' reaction videos for it, just to vicariously relive that experience."
"Me too. Nothing after that made me as amazed as this. 

It gave me Lotr in the cinema feeling back. "
I drove home and had to remind myself not to try to ram other vehicles on the road. 😂
Same here.
"Not only was it, but it was also a phenomenal Summer 2019 watch, around 6 months before the world shut down. I’d regularly watch this as a comfort movie during the pandemic and wonder if we’d ever manage to enjoy films together in a theater like that again."
"Into the Spiderverse paved the way for a different animation style to take over movies. I was getting pretty tired of the CGI plasticky look that Disney and Pixar have been putting out, so when a movie like The Last Wish comes out, I’m pleasantly surprised. I just hope it’s not overdone and gets tired out"
I’m pretty sure I held my breath for the entire opening sequence the first time I saw Into the Spiderverse - I’ve never seen anything that stunning in animation before. It really is a work of art.
Same. I told anyone who would listen how amazing that movie was and dragged a few friends/family to the theater to see it.
"Can’t beat a properly done Bruckheimer production! Both those felt like the old days when he was working with Tony Scott and Michael Bay, and I mean that in the best way possible."
"Agree on HTTYD.  Initially, I wasn't impressed with the trailers because the dragons are identical to the animated movie.  But seeing them interact with people was great!"
"While they don’t come too often, there’s definitely more than just F1 (which I loved btw). Mad Max: Fury Road, Dunkirk, Mission Impossible Fallout, Top Gun Maverick, The Batman. Those are just my picks."
Same director as Top Gun: Maverick.
It really is. S tier cinema
Took my team to see it yesterday. Really surprised. It was great. I may see it again.
just saw it. So freaking good. Same director I think.
"This will definitely see rereleases over the years, especially if/when Top Gun 3 happens."
First and only movie I saw in D-Box. Was well worth it!
I had to see it twice. So good
I nearly cried with excitement.
"Did you at least hold the iPad 4 inches in front of your face, so it felt like Imax?"
Did that to us on the small screen.  Great movie.
"That entire movie felt like several smaller movies building into one massive movie overarching thing. 

Every “chapter” of the movie was: set up, small issue, tension, plunge, crazy tension, mission success, cliffhanger for next setup. And the stakes were set so high in the very beginning, so it was the tension that had to rise more and more with each part of the plot. The submarine scene was so quiet, so full of potential problems, juxtaposed with the tensions rising above the surface… I know the climax of the movie was technically after that, but that scene just came drenched in stress, and it was so well done"
"I always try to do opening weekend if not opening night for these, the crowd vibes hit different. It's half the fun!"
[deleted]
"Dude I actually said the same thing about it for me. I've been telling my friends that the movie felt like it was made *just for me.*

I love horror. I love music. I love slice of life.

How the fuck is the movie all three?"
there are haters? Who hates Sinners!?
It's the least subtle movie ever and I love it for that
"As a DnD fan, you can see failed dice rolls in the movie"
"Thinking of making the characters from the movie in Baldurs Gate 3 so they can have a new adventure.Bard, Barbarian, Druid, Sorcerer? Yeah, I can jive with that setup"
"No spoilers please, but did it live up to your expectations?

Going tonight and I really want to like it."
Is it getting a lot of hate? I loved everything about it lol. Even that ending. It all just worked for me
It is fairly close to life living in Newcastle to be fair
The sea bridge scene was so beautiful
It was GLORIOUS!! Me and the 7 other dudes in the theatre all though so haha.
We've (royal we've) just gotten to where we're chasing the feeling not even the thing anymore. I feel jaded saying this but I'll take high effort big swing and misses all day long if there's some heart and authenticity behind it.
Did we just become best friends?
2019 is the greatest movie/shows single year of all time.
"Agree!  I remember when ""The Bad Guys"" came out.  I thought it was great that it had kind of a ""painterly"" look to it, unlike the ""plasticly"" look as you described.  I wondered if the movie had benefitted from Spiderverse's success.  Another good example of ""softer"" animation is ""The Wild Robot""."
I think it’s more director Joseph Kosinski and his style of visuals and camera placement that puts you right in the action.
"of what you've listed I've enjoyed all those movies and most are ones I'd wished I watched in theaters.

For me the theater quality has taken a hit and makes going to watch a movie less enjoyable (often have sound from the next screen bleeding into the one I'm in or poor audio quality in general).

I watched F1 in Imax (first time I've sprung for Imax in a long time) and it definitely felt worth it (especially as an F1 fan) and the audio was great, a welcome change from my usual."
...and also same producer (Jerry Bruckheimer) aswell as the same film score composer (Hans Zimmer).
Back pain. So much back pain
Saw it twice.. better the 2nd time.
The movie came out early a month before I graduated. I had to make sure not to hear any spoilers until I saw it.
Guys who don’t go down
"Hollywood executives who don’t want an original idea to take off, “movie reviewers” with an agenda (I’m looking at you Critical Drinker)"
"Completely. Without getting into spoilers, it is a big blockbuster version of a Saturday morning cartoon in all the best ways. It captures all the silliness of comic books in a really loving, uncynical, and earnest way. That may not be for everyone but if it is...so so good. I teared up multiple times.

Easily my favorite Superman movie and I can't wait to see it again."
"Lindisfarne, just off Northumberland, if you're from the UK. They've taken liberties because the causeway is pretty much a road, but it's an absolutely beautiful place to visit."
Wild Robot was so fucking good
This is why I really wanted him to do another Tron. Legacy looked amazing!
"I have chronic back pain so if it gave me any, I didn't notice haha"
Good one.
"Naked Gun was hysterical, it might be the first movie in a LONG time that I see twice in the theater."
"These are the top 10 highest grossing films of 2025 so far:


* Ne Zha 2 - $2.19 billion
* Lilo & Stitch - $1.02 billion
* A Minecraft Movie - $955 million
* Jurassic World: Rebirth - $766 million
* How To Train Your Dragon - $614 million
* MI: The Final Reckoning - $594 million
* Superman - $551 million
* F1 - $545 million 
* Captain America: BNW - $415 million
* Thunderbolts - $382 million"
"I'm actually surprised Naked Gun wasn't a bit higher than $17 million. We went to see it last weekend and the theater was *packed* in a way that's rare to see movie theaters these days, almost every seat filled. 


Sure, it was just one observation from one theater, but usually when it's like that the movie was a pretty big draw overall. The only times I've really seen bigger crowds than that recently were for the opening weekends of MCU movies; these crowds looked about on par with Beetlejuice which brought in 6x more money."
"Marvel has been criticized for relying on too many quips, jokes, meaningless action sequences, and shitty writing/art direction/cinematography.

Thunderbolts* & Fantastic Four literally fixed all of these issues and audiences still didn't show up.

They have to be so confused at this point."
Not surprised about Demon Slayer it's the final arc and the animation looks crazy.
[deleted]
"I took my kids to see Bad Guys 2 and it's good. The 3rd act is a banger and the animation is amazing. It really puts into perspective how far behind Pixar is in this department. They seem stuck with their ""pixar look"" while everyone else is looking for a unique style for each film."
Can't wait to see Infinity Castle in theaters.
"Down in Aussie, Fantastic Four actually held alright at 43% week 2 drop, which puts it exactly in the middle of all MCU Weekend 2 % drops.  

That said it's easier to maintain a lower % drop when the movie doesn't even open in the top 5 openings of the year. (FF opened as the 7th highest opening of the year down here).  

But as a silver lining, as with international it is now the highest Fantastic Four movie (Unadjusted for inflation) so yay for that and it's already almost closed the gap on both other MCU movies from this year and should pass them both in the next week or two without too much sweat.  

As usual down here we also have some Indian cinema making it's way into the weekly charts with both Chal Mera Putt 4 opening in number 5 and Saiyaara at number 8 after 3 weeks of release. An Indian film holding around that long in the top 10 is fairly rare and they put out those numbers off under 100 screens.  

Oh and Bride Hard opened down here, which I expected to do a bit better locally since Rebel Wilson is an Aussie, but landed with the same dud over here, opening outside the top 10, with $234k."
"I just got out of watching FF and I can see why it's collapsing. I literally just saw it because I caught a super cheap sale in a theater. Movie was kind of boring, I liked the Surfer and the space stuff, but there are so many baffling choices and characters have zero arcs.

No to mention there's no buildup to Doomsday, no relationships established with him whatsoever. Galactus was also lame as fuck, even cloud Galactus was more intimidating that this one, cloud Galactus also almost won and the Surfer pay-off was done better."
It's Pedrover 
"Will the marketing dept give up on the movie, or press on?"
People don’t care about theaters like they used to
I kinda hate the narrative that a movie can make 100% profit and still be deemed a failure… 
Why don't people want to spend 16 dollars on a ticket??
I like Pedro Pascal a lot but the moment they announced his casting my expectations landed on “bland by the numbers studio film I can skip until streaming.” Looks like I was not alone.
Probably because the movie was boring as fuck and poor word of mouth does damage.
fantastic four was boring for more than half the movie ngl… not surpised it disappointed in the box office
"Interesting, if anything, I would have expected better legs for Fantastic Four. 

It released right in the middle of San Diego ComicCon. So a good chunk of the prime audience was occupied opening weekend, and would need to go the following week. 

Guess not. "
"Not surprised with the fantastic four drop off it wasn't a very good movie and a lot of people are just sick to death of superheroes.
not surprised with the fantastic four drop off it wasn't a very good movie and a lot of people are just sick to death of superheroes.

The naked gun is a made for TV movie and younger people really don't have any interest in it.

The movies right now are pretty lackluster. Combine that with 40 minutes of commercials and a few previews and fewer and fewer people are going to be going to the movies."
Oh shit the Demon Slayer movie is coming??
"Having seen both Superman and F4, I feel like F4 needed to be maybe just a little more fun to retain. I get what they’re going for, but retrofuturism should have a bit more pep to it, and F4 as a team have more of a goofy charm to them in this era. And the WOM did not help sell the positives of the movie like it did for Superman. 

What I’m really focused on is Naked Gun. My hope is that the strong word of mouth and the fact that it’s the funniest fucking thing I’ve seen in a theater in a hot minute might give it legs through August. It’s a pitch perfect reboot of the originals that feels as funny as they were. While also having moments that feel like Akiva’s other movies. There are serious Hot Rod moments that made me so happy. It’s so wonderfully weird."
"If my local movie theaters weren't gross and took better care of the AV equipment I would've seen FF and Superman already.

I'm not dropping $20 to sit in sticky seats when I can wait until it's on streaming"
"The thing with Thunderbolts and Fantastic Four...

Is that for superheroes, their powers are lame as fuck. 

There's like better, more powerful versions of every single one of them within Marvel."
Lol
I liked Fantastic Four more than Superman. It's a shame it's not doing as good.
The messaging of this movie didn’t land well with me at all. My buzzwordy hot take is that Fantastic 4 glorifies techno-facism.
"Gotta love how Hollywood frames these things. 

“Collapses” but still brings in a third of a billion over a weekend. Smdh."
"So understandable that everyone is in panic mode about the large drop... But that is considering that they had a nice sized first week. But I think that data shows all ticket sales are down, and nobody went to the movies. Let's see,  what could it be????? How about the average person doesn't have as much expendable cash?!?!? Perhaps."
"When I saw they included a cutesy little robot in the FF trailers, I immediately knew this was not worth my paying to see in the theater.   Everything MCU these days scream ""Disney+"""
Jesus who's reading all that bullshit
The Naked Gun seems right on to me. Who thought that was a good idea.....
I guess Liam and Pam can finally drop the dating act. It wasn't enough to get people to watch the movie. Nobody believed they were a couple. Or cared. The press tried to make fetch happen. They didn't.
"I didn't want to dare to hope but we saw it last night and they got everything perfect. The writers and director understand the source material and Neeson by god totally gets it! He nails it perfectly. He IS the new Frank Drebin and I hope we get a half dozen more installments.   

And on top of that, how impressive was Pamela Anderson!? She was game for it all and nailed the perfect tone. I could absolutely see her turning up in sequels and building on what they all did here in this one.   

Absolutely (and kinda improbably) ***perfect***. This has been the best movie summer since before the pandemic and Im overjoyed with how its all played out.   

# Do not wait for streaming. See this in a theater with people you dont know and laugh yourself stupid."
I said the same about Superman
CA making more than thunderbolts is so sad. Exact opposite side of the spectrum in terms of quality.
"Sequel

~~Established franchise~~ - sorry y’all my brain read F4 instead of F1. So there’s an original 

Established franchise

Established franchise

Remember when everyone used to whine how they wanted more original movies? You sure aren’t telling Hollywood that."
"That Rebirth is outpacing Superman is wild. Probably the best indicator that it's not about quality or general franchise fatigue, but very specific to superhero movies to currently be unable to deliver against expectations."
"God things are dire from a quality standpoint. Outside of Ne Zha 2 which I haven’t seen, the only 2 I really unabashedly loved were Superman and Thunderbolts."
Pretty sad to see. Its all just sequel/remake slop. A Minecraft Movie is the only true original story on that list which is kind of pathetic lol
"On the other hand it had way less showtimes. My AMC only had 3 showings the whole day and it was in a crappy theater seating, not the newer recliner."
"I had the opposite anecdotal experience. I live near a pretty big theatre and although they had a bunch of showings for Naked Gun, there were barely any tickets sold at all."
I haven't seen it yet (waiting for my brother to have time available) and I'm bummed I didn't try and see it opening day
We'll have to see but it feels like it may have good legs. I had other stuff I wanted to see last week but will be making time this week after seeing the good reviews and hearing good things
It’s gonna leg out all month. Land around $75M for a cheap comedy.
"My local theater only had a single late night showing on the bigger more expensive screen, while every other showtime was on the ""standard"" screen with cheaper seats. It was only maybe 1/3 full"
The Naked Gun could end up having legs or crushing it on demand. The WOM is really positive.
"> They have to be so confused at this point.

Michael Bay fucked up Transformers in the end so bad that not enough people showed up for Bumblebee, Rise of the Beast and animated they did.

Once the brand gets ruined, it's hard to get the audience back.

For MCU, it will probably be one of the next big ""bring back everyone"" events to get people back in the seats. However, those films will probably also be some of the most expensive ever made (due to expensive cast) so it's gonna be hard to be profitable."
"The reputational damage seems to be pretty significant for the wider audience, even if more die hard fans are happy with the recent product.

Purely anecdotal, but I feel like it's way harder for me to convince friends and family to go with me to Marvel stuff. I dragged my gf to a couple mediocre marvel movies, and now she really has no interest in fantastic four. Doesn't help that everything is more expensive now."
it's very hard to win back an audience once they've been lost. Spiderman will make money because he always makes money but i think the rest will stay slow until Doomday.
"Once you've used up all your goodwill, it's hard to build it back up. Marvel really went to shit as they started with all the Disney plus shows. This also proves the audience for MCU with C list characters is not the same as Spiderman or Deadpool audiences, the overlap is shrinking."
I just hope they don't learn the wrong lesson and we go back to shitty movies like Thor 4 or Quantumania
"Audiences have had enough with Marvel movies. They aren't going to watch Marvel movies forever and the franchise needs to end, not last forever."
"I mean, 20 years on constant superhero movies is getting tiring.  Where else can you take a superhero that is new and interesting?  Shit is all the same, and people are done.  It is time for the superheroes to take a break."
"Fantastic Four really didn't fix this issue. It felt largely the same to me as any MCU movie. 

Just because it has a 60s filter doesn't mean it's not still boring storytelling where no one really evolved. The edits that cut down a ton of stories didn't help either."
"Marvel's problem is that they had a formula and it's been done so much that it's stale. Now that people saw the end of the Thanos saga, they feel like they got to the end of the story and want something new. The MCU isn't built to be that though. 

They really needed to come out the gate swinging for the new phase. They didn't. Then Kang flopping probably kneecapped interest."
We're in the 90's comic book drought era. Where it's flooded and is gonna go out of style for a bit. Until some big event like death of superman happens.
"F4 is a better marvel movie than some of the previous ones, but it is still a far cry from a great movie. The smartest man alive paints a huge fucking target on his family’s backs for no reason in the middle of the movie and that’s just bad writing. And of course the villain misses an obvious win.

When there are no smart people in a movie supposedly full of smart people, it’s hard to laud the movie."
Everyone knows it’s going to be on Disney+ in 3 months. They need to change that model.
"Their problem is they don't want to take bigger risks to make a good movie.  Cutting down your movie from a lot of character development will not let the audience get invested enough to actually love a movie.  Most of the online talk around this movie is it's fine or it's alright.  Positives being the different vibe and world, negatives being the movie is too short/a concept rather than a fully fleshed out world with fleshed out characters and story.  There was a good version of this movie, but the final cut of this movie is not that.  You can literally find so many cut scenes, characters, and moments from the trailers that probably would have added a lot more to this movie, but Marvel cut it out probably because Feige succumbed to the suits/execs who said it has to be under 2 hours"
Cant speak to Thunderbolts* but I feel like I watched a different Fantastic Four than most people cause it was not as good as redditors and reviews made it out to be. And it did not fix the poor art direction or cinematography. I'm a Pedro Pascal stan and a Michael Giacchino stan but even they weren't able to elevate this movie from mediocre.
"I can only speak for myself. 

This one may well be better than the last duds, but it’s simply not worth the time, effort or money to go see it. 

I’m personally so burnt out with fatigue with Marvel, that I’d rather just see it in a few months when it inevitably premieres on Disney Plus."
Fantastic Four did not fix those issues what? Cinematography and quips were mostly fine but it’s an uninspired boring action movie that’s mostly a rehash of the previous rise of silver surfer film
"Did we see the same movie? Thunderbolts had all of that, in spades."
"They burned the audiences with their boring, mediocre post Thanos output. and now they reap what they sow, good films just getting trampled on.

Marvel need to treat this as their Batman Begins. Build well from here, rebuild the bridges burnt with fans and return to decent box office."
People want avenger style movies. That simple.
"I do think both were enjoyable movies, they got my money. But if I'm comparing Fantastic Four to the very best FF comics I could read or the best action/sci-fi movies I could watch, it's not fully measuring up. For me, all the characters were so close to the characters I love from the comics (and portrayed much better than in previous adaptations), but still not quite perfect. I really would have loved more time with the Silver Surfer actually reckoning with the choice to actively rebel against Galactus. Or a little bit of edge to Ben that shows he's a teddy bear 90% of the time... but how he could be really scary if he lost control.

Still, it's doing better than the 2005 film adjusted for inflation and that one got a sequel. I do think a second FF film could build on a solid baseline of quality established with the first movie and could flesh out the characters more since the hard work of establishing their outlines is already done."
"It’s because Captain America was so bad, and Thunderbolts came so shortly after. People went because it was a CA movie (and they had all been good) but got a bad taste in their mouth after seeing it, serious disappointment, and felt it wasn’t worth paying for, so asking them to pay again just a few month later didn’t work. 

They should have released CA straight to streaming and just focused on Thunderbolts and F4 this year."
They say it takes like 5 positive interactions to offset one negative. The reputational damage is probably done
Thunderbolts had quips galore
"I think the issue is that kids don't really go to the cinema anymore unless they are taken by adults and its probably a very set thing where dads will take their kids to see superhero movies.

If thunderbolts and fantastic four had a longer run I would've probably seen them in the cinema but I missed thunderbolts and probably won't have time to see fantastic four. The last two superhero movies I did see with my son were Superman and that Captain America/ Red Hulk movie. I had to get his mum to collect him early from Superman as he was so bored and the Captain America movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen.

I guess my point is that the films aren't in the cinema long enough and that when you do finally get round to seeing them they don't really appeal to kids."
"Super Hero fatigue, economic factors (I.e. going to the movies is really expensive), and people knowing it will be streaming in a few months are all playing a factor."
"Imo it also lost all excitement, chemistry and wittiness. I was supremely bored watching F4 and the rest of the audience in my showing was also deathly silent the entire time. I watched it on Friday the week it came out."
Quite simple. The damage done is too much. A lot of people have given up on Marvel.
"That's why they brought back RDJ.

Literally hitting the panic button. 

There's a chance that thunderbolts and FF do well on streaming, which might boost the next MCU film. Also doesn't help they made the changes in their philosophy with movies that had unknown characters."
because theyve been serving so much shit
"More than anything, the problem with Marvel has been the bad writing. Thunderbolts and Fantastic Four are continuing the trend."
">too many quips, jokes, meaningless action sequences, and shitty writing/art direction/cinematography.

The general audience doesn't give a shit about any of that. Yes you may need to reassess your style when refreshing your brand but that isn't why the MCU is failing next to say... weak characters and dull concepts.

Like I don't give a shit about the Thunderbolts and the marketing didn't tell me anything about them but **ha-ha** they all run and shoot. So Suicide Squad but without anything quirky like a fucking shark or maniac pixie clown girl. Grrrreattt. 

Then there's that z-tier supershit that Marvel needs to fucking delete. Seriously of all the fucking superclones Sentry is the worst, a bad joke that didn't just fail completely at humor but then forgot it was even a joke. Not that I'd know anything about how he was actually going to be handled in the movie from the marketing. 

Not that I blame the marketing, reading the actual spoilers doesn't make me feel I missed much.

Which has been the problem over and over again with the MCU lately. 

Even what's good they make just baffling choices with. Like why do you take your strongest debut outside Black Panther and decide oh yeah for the sequel instead of more super saiyan girl blasting starships and flying around at mach 10 you're going to go with.... Freaky fucking Friday? Because **ha-ha** other girls have used the Marvel name? Yeah that was totally going to work on an audience who barely knows who Ms Marvel and Ms Nextwave are. Also totally a Wii U situation not calling Captain Marvel 2. 

As for First Steps well I dare suggest they were getting better but when Reed started talking about ""family dinner"" in the trailers they needed to immediately smash cut to some absolute disaster around the table with them all screaming at each other. Because the FF are Marvel's 'first family' because Kirby and Lee had the great innovation to write some actual fucking people with problems, concerns, and squabbles in contrast to the Justice League and early Silver Age heroes in general being immaculate (and often high handed) paladins of justice. The FF are a family because they aren't just a hero team up not because they exude any sort of wholesome classic family values. In fact they are a subversion albeit one that would become pretty damn standard across comics

Anyways failing that they needed to focus on the actual traditional family unit in there and lead with>!Galactus wants Franklin or Earth dies !<with a story focused  Reed and Sue forced to make impossible choices."
">Marvel has been criticized for relying on too many quips, jokes, meaningless action sequences, and shitty writing/art direction/cinematography.

This is thunderbolts to a tee though. Haven't seen F4 and probably won't."
"THos are also lower tier, people arent going to be as hyped for them.  

Fantastic 4 has also had 2 recent attempts that just didnt work out so well"
"I mean these are like movies 35 and 36 or something in the MCU, or however many there are at this point.

Too little too late?

I haven’t seen a superhero movie since Endgame because I’m just tired of seeing them at this point. Not saying there is superhero fatigue, but for me personally I guess there might be."
It's the cost of tickets unfortunately.
I never believed that was an issue in of itself. This feels like giving general audiences too much credit. Look at the top 3 Hollywood movies of the year so far.
I think the MCU just lost the general audience too many bad movies have have soured the opinion. There's also the fact that everyone is in agreement that Secret Wars will reboot the franchise so a lot of people may not want to invest too much into it. They'll catch it on D+
Yeah it really sucks win the studio can't figure out that your movies have to be good if you want people to watch them
"F4 was so bland. None of the cast fit their roles.

Don't pair it with the far superior Thunderbolts"
"It's doing OK but times have just changed. It will be really hard to replicate the superhero success of the 2010s and pre-Endgame days (and pre-Covid days). Hitting $400M - $500M is good, very unlikely for a movie with a new cast of characters to easily cross into $600-700M like they used to, even familiar characters like F4 and Superman. Avengers:Doomsday next year will be a real test."
"I had a strong “why am I watching this” feeling when I watched FF. It was overall good, it just felt meaningless. The characters are not overly compelling in any way and it’s been rebooted so many times"
I haven't read too many FF-centric comics but have seen them show up other comics and I always liked them. This movie didn't feel like it got them right but you probably know them more than I do. I was pretty disappointed with this movie
Maybe it's time to take off the fanboyism glasses
"> Down in Aussie

Are you sure you're an Aussie?"
"People like Pedro but I didn't think he's a big draw on his own. Which is basically the trend for all movie stars. Even Tom Cruise can't get people to go see his last Mission Impossible.

People follow IP and don't really care who is in it (unless it's someone terrible). 

Jurassic World - Rebirth has made tons but it had nothing to do with Scar-Jo and M-Ali. Terrible terrible writing, but Dinos + the brand name still equals big money."
🧢. Plenty of films broke $700 mill this year. Marvel just sucks now
"Stop coping, someone literally put a chart of movies hitting 1 billion or close to that this year. Accept F4 just wasn't it "
Is Pascal a box office draw? I can’t name a single other person in the movie. There are familiar faces like the guy from Stranger Things and the guy from The Bear.
I guess he just has a great agent. He's a good actor but yeah I'm not dying to see him in stuff.
"If you saw the trailers you saw the entire movie -_-

Movie was wack"
"How many people and money do you think comic con accounts for? Like 10k max. So $200,000"
No chance the Comic-Con crowd is missing opening weekend for Fantastic 4. They factored it into their schedule.
I highly doubt Comic Con in San Diego made much of an impact at all on F4’s overall box office performance
"Lmao. Oh no, that's a max of ~$2 million (very much upper range, assuming *everyone* at ComicCon would have gone to it, which is a hilarious assumption, and didn't yet). ComicCon is huge, but not *cause a noticeable artificial depression in box office* huge"
F4 should've got Muzan instead of Galactus.
"Dropping 67% and 60% after the opening weekend came in under expectations isn't collapsing?

> but still brings in a third of a billion over a weekend.

That money is after playing for almost two weeks, not one weekend."
"That robot is called Herbie and exists in the source material ....

FF was actually pretty fun"
That's a pretty successful opening weekend though.
Weird comment
"Crazy to think that Anna Nicole Smith was in the 1994 Naked Gun sequel, and if she were alive today would be the same age as Pamela Anderson, give or take a few months."
"Yes, absolutely seeing this with a room full of strangers was awesome, everyone loved it. And yes, Pam was amazing! A worthy successor to Priscilla Presley for sure, she killed it"
CA does this really need an abbreviation
"Unsurprising though, captain america movies are so central to the MCU they're perceived like a mini avengers movie in terms of importance. Thunderbolts sounds and looks generic, I don't even remember if bucky was featured heavily in the marketing. Definitely would be perceived as an irrelevant gaiden story"
Haven't seen Captain America yet I thought Thunderbolts was pretty awful until the third quarter of the film
How is F1 an established franchise?
People who want more original movies are film fans and critics. I'd say they make up MAYBE 25% of all moviegoers. The money is earned off the casuals and the families
"Hell, it's been that way for quite some time. Last year the 4 top worldwide grossing movies were at the very least sequels, and the top 10 were much the same as this year. The year before of the top 10, I think only one wasn't a reboot, sequel, or based on a video game, toy line, or book was Full River Red, which I'm not sure released in theaters outside of China. 

There were a couple others that seemed like they only released in China in 2020 and 2021, but without those you have to go back nearly a decade for Inside Out and Secret Life of Pets for anything that would be considered original IP (I'm not counting Bohemian Rhapsody since, while it wasn't based on a book or anything, I'm not sure basing it on an actual person counts as original...)

Edit: In fact, it looks like the last time more than 3 (and at least half) of the top grossing movies weren't sequels, reboots, part of franchises, etc. was 2000, with Gladiator, Cast Away, What Women Want, Dinosaur, and What Lies Beneath (which I don't *think* was published before the movie...)"
[deleted]
it's easier to sell movies like jurassic world internationally compared to something like superman.
"Most people figured Rebirth would outpace Superman. Regardless of quality, dinosaurs make money (most of the time). More people were comparing Superman and F4."
f1 is original
the amcs i have been to had crappy theater seating only for the best screens and recliners for the regular screens.
"I went to a Saturday evening showing, the theater held over 300 people and they were less than 10 people watching the movie."
Didn't see many at my theatre either. Nice big theatre downtown incredibly easy to get to. Audience was having fun though.
"Personally I hope so. If nothing else, it was definitely *different* from what you normally see in theaters these days. It's good to see slapstick and dumb gags get their turn every once in a while!"
"Yeah, we used to get an Avengers movie every few years. Endgame came out 6 years ago. Those movies were events that everybody came out for and gave everyone renewed interest in the franchise. Then Endgame happened and we stopped getting Avengers movies and started getting a bunch of D+ shows that nobody really asked for instead. It was a bad tradeoff."
"Event films will make it big, no matter what. But no solo outings are guarenteed hits. Gotta make smart budget decisions. "
"> Michael Bay fucked up Transformers in the end so bad that not enough people showed up for Bumblebee, Rise of the Beast and animated they did.

I didn't watch the one before Bumblebee, but I can't imagine that it can be any worse than the Beast Wars one. What a wasted opportunity that was, it would've been such a great soft-reboot/prequel if it followed the plot of the cartoon."
"Which is too bad in a way. Bumblebee I legitimately enjoy, the beast one was extremely ok, and transformers one I liked a lot.  It's too bad they figured out the formula after they poisoned the well. On the other hand, we got plenty of transformers movies and the world will go on just fine without another one.

 I wonder if One made enough to be a success if they didn't have to pay celebrity salaries for the voices? Not really sure why the obsession with hiring celebrities instead of proper voice actors for animated movies. I get the idea, celebrities draw people in... but I didn't go see the Mario movie to hear Pratt or Charlie Day."
"No matter how “successful” the first movie is, audiences will say they want to see these characters again only next time interacting with other characters they’re more familiar with (Shang Chi), unless of course they don’t want that, and the studio never knows until they actually make that second movie they’re in."
"How much does the target audience play into the turnout? The build-up to Infinity War/Endgame took 11 years and 22 films (23 if you include Far From Home which released just after Endgame) to come to completion. You're looking at an audience that watched Iron Man and Captain America when they were in elementary school and then Endgame when they were in/graduating from college. With Endgame and the films that came out afterwards, the audience then lost the Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor that they grew up supporting.  
  
Obviously there's space for new characters and heroes, but each new film is PG-13 and targeted at a younger audience. The films have also become very formulaic at this point, there are now supporting TV shows, and there's a constant churn of new characters getting introduced to replace the cast that bowed out in the hopes of finding the new marketable super-team. Add in the multiverse stuff and the people who aren't paying close attention have no idea what's going on and what characters are active.  
  
But ultimately, the core cast completed their stories and the kids who became attached to them are well into adulthood at this point. Those adults aren't as willing to watch 20+ PG-13 movies and TV shows setting up a new MCU storyline when the one they cared about has already finished. That doesn't mean that those people don't care about the MCU anymore, it just means that they're less invested these days and if they're going to watch one of these films, they're only going to turn out for the big ones with an ensemble cast. And they'll likely get the cliff notes of all the new characters before they watch it.  
  
Or actually, another random thought - all of these films end up on the rather cheap Disney+ platform within 2-3 months, so if people do care enough to watch these films, they're likely just waiting for them to hit the streaming platform."
Spider-Man will likely be that big film for them.
"See you got it completely wrong. The die hard fans have been furiously disappointed for years now, that is why they aren't buying what disney is selling. i am a real person that lives in the real world. EVery single friend i have is what you could call a die hard fan. They literally own comic books, they have tattoos and everything. They basically hate every single marvel movie to release in like the last 5 years. These same people could argue that 'fans' that have been gobbling up everything disneys shits out for the last 5 years is no true fan at all.

I don't even care to argue this with anyone. If you disagree, you are wrong. It seems that the definition of 'die hard fan' needs to be disputed and defined because your definition is utterly ass backward from what mine is. I dismiss the notion that die hard fans are generally satisfied with the quality disney has been putting out since end game with hostility."
"Also, look at who they are making movies about. Your Average Joe does not know or care about The Eternals, Shang Chi, The Thunderbolts, or The Marvels. None of those are getting people to theaters. 

The Post-Endgame Spidey movies did great, as did Deadpool/Wolverine. 

Which reminds me, it's been 6 years since Disney purchased Fox and we still don't have a Disney X-men movie (outside of Deadpool which was still sort of tied to the Fox timeline). If there is one property that is guaranteed to get butts back in seats outside of Spidey and Avengers, it's X-Men done properly. How have they still not made one!?!"
"I hopped off the Marvel train at Endgame. 

Only went back to the theatre to see No Way Home. 


Quality aside. Getting back onboard with the MCU is more daunting than it’s worth, miss a few films and go into a recent one, who’s this character? What’s that plot device? What’s that reference? They died? 

If you didn’t get on the Marvel train at the beginning and stayed on, it’s a bigger job than it’s worth to hop back on."
The last Spider-Man was pretty much nostalgia bait. The movie itself was just okay and really breaks down the more you think about it.
"Twenty scenes of someone almost dying then being saved, ethics that would make the dali llama blush and a world ending threat that comes down to the very last second, then all tied up neatly, see you in a few months for the next one."
"The issue isn’t the superhero genre. Deadpool and Wolverine made over $1 billion last year, GotG3 made over $800 million in 2023, The Batman made over $700 million in 2022 and Superman is doing pretty well at almost $600 million. Clearly there is still a healthy appetite for the genre. The real issues were more complex than that. For Marvel, the hype for the MCU had died down after the massive payoff that was Endgame and instead of building connective tissue to hype up the following movies and generate interest again, Marvel put out a slew of mid projects with no sense of direction for where the franchise was going. The hype of the Avengers films carried a lot of the more mid Phase 1 - 3 MCU movies to big success and there was nothing like that post Endgame until recently. 

In terms of DC, they had been in freefall since the failure of Justice League, completely aimless with no sense of direction at all, throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. James Gunn announcing the rebooted universe sealed the deal for the final DCEU movies, nobody wanted to invest in a movie in a franchise they know is dying ahead of time. Thunderbolts and F4 are still feeling the effects of Marvel’s bad decision making even though they’re being praised as the best Marvel movies in years. I think it’s moreso that people are more wary of mediocre superhero movies than they were during the 2010s, but when the movie is good the audience (usually) still shows up"
"Hard disagree. I can't stand people trying to use this argument. The problem isn't superhero movie fatigue, the problem is that they keep making bad movies and shows. the movies are shit. It isn't any more complicated than that. You make bad movie after bad movie and people stop looking forward to your movies. If there is so much fatigue, why are there so many that i look forward to? Peacemaker, invincible, the boys; these are all examples of stuff i am waiting to see. i am not looking for to some new 'woke' boring marvel movie based on comics nobody likes in the first place, and then changed to be even worse than that. 

Take ironheart. Nobody liked those comics. Like nobody at all. That is just a fact. Yet they chose that out of the million other choices they had, to make a big series and create a new member of the mcu. That is already boring and lame. But then on top of that, they didn't even adapt her. They made her something completely different than her own comic. They changed everything about her character into something worse. Then the show very predictably bombs and people like you show up talking 'bout superhero fatique. the problem is that the show is bad. It is jsut that simple. On top of just being bad, it makes fans angry. This was hundreds of millions of dollars and the greater part of a decade wasted on something that nobody wanted that could have been used to make something people would love. So it's more than just the show is bad and I don't like it, we have actually been deprived of something we would gladly pay for.

The wrong people are in charge, and until that changes we will keep getting crap movies and shows. Even movies people end up actually liking, like fantastic 4, they are still on shaky ground. It still feels like someone who is out of touch is humoring some of the variables that the target audience says are important to make the kinds of movies they love and when the movies do succeed they don't actually understand what about it made that so. They are dancing on the edge of failure and people call it good enough.

The casuals might be tired of superheros, but there is a huge audience that is ready and eager for more, and that audience has the most disposable wealth to spend on such things. Make what the fans want and they will give you money. It doesn't get any simpler than that. The fans never wanted ironheart, it was always going to fail. Even in a thread talking about how fantastic 4 made nearly 400 million bucks you are over here saying people don't want to watch superhero movies any more. That is direct proof that you are wrong, whether the movie is considered a financial success or not. 400 million is not nothing and it certainly justifies them to keep making more movies, which is why that is exactly what they are going to keep doing."
"I completely agree with this. Idk how so many people were praising Fantastic Four like it was the second coming of Marvel. Set my expectations too high and came out really really underwhelmed.

The 60s aesthetics were nice yes but... it's not enough to patch up a movies deficits"
"They also took all of the various iterations of the source material and discarded them, and then went with an original Frankenstein version of the fantastic 4. Just pick one of the comic stories that people liked and then make that into a movie. Don't try to make something different for no reason. it;s actually more work to make the shit they are making, just copy what they know works. It is that simple. Take the highest selling comics and then just make *that*. There is enough content there to make movies for decades. Quit taking wild swings and risks. Give budgets to people that actually like the stories and let them make movies."
"I still keep up with the MCU although way way less than before, I still go to the theater, but I haven’t seen an MCU movie in the theater since No Way Home"
This is the real issue. They have shown to everyone you can just wait for disney +. Movies like Spiderman and Doomsday will do gang busters because they are big event films. But i wouldn't be shocked if anyone told me they were waiting for Disnet + for the 3 movies released this year. 
"How many times did Yelena groan out a ""oh my god"" like a 10 year old?"
"Very few MCU movies have ever been well written in the first place.

It's more likely people are just burned out after dozens of these samey films"
"Yeah, everyone is pretending like Thunderbolts and F4 are masterpieces of filmmaking. They're okay, but okay isn't enough after so many duds."
Mf how are the Fantastic Four lower tier.
I gurantee you fiege and Disney don’t think it’s doing OK lol
"Yeah I felt like it was ""fine"". Not bad but i haven't recommended it to anyone."
"Based on the top 10 list, four movies have done so this year. I don't know how that compares to previous years at this point."
Nobodies watching these marvel movies; the ones who do end up watching the recent ones end up saying they’re rather good movies but it doesn’t seem to matter because the audience simply isn’t showing up like how they used to… I mean ant man and The Wasp made 700m+ and F4 can only dream of making that even though it’s 100x better.
"Huh? It was well reviewed and liked. In the past the movie would have done great. People just don’t go to the theater as much as they used to. Yes some movies made a lot of money this year, but people are way more picky about their choices. Especially with streaming and plex."
"Pedro, Joseph, and Ebon are all well liked actors from TV shows with decent followings.

But I don't really get the ""movie star"" vibe from any of them."
"I'm too lazy to look up the cast, I'll probably do it right after this actually, but I'd the stranger things guy Steve's actor? I might watch it if it's him."

The excuses some people will come up with for bad numbers is amazing.
"Pamela was the original choice for 33 1/3 as well, she couldn’t do it because of scheduling conflicts."
Americans do this all the time and I hate it so much.
Capt. Am’ca.
If only they use the name New Avenger since the beginning
"The new Captain America felt like they didn't have a script when filming. That, plus everything's on a green screen or in the least interesting location possible. CGI is bad too. 


If you didn't like Thunderbolts, then there is nothing for you in BNW "
"Hard disagree. As someone who thinks half of phase 4 and 5 films aren't worth a rewatch, Thunderbolts was great through and through and I hope they make more movies like it."
"Yes, i agree. I watched both and would rate them pretty close, like 6 ish maybe 6.5 for thunderbolts, idk the yelena story was kinda annoying, felt way too forced."
"~~The same way Superman is.~~

~~I get that these are new continuities for both, but they are not new IP or characters, and Fantastic Four is part of the MCU on top of that.~~

Edit: my brain totally derped"
I’m very well aware of that and was simply making a quick generalization. But thanks for the baseless insult.
"Both Minecraft and F1 are based on incredibly popular existing IPs. I'm not sure I'd call either truly original.

That said, God knows I'd take a good Horizon: Zero Dawn or Mass Effect adaptation over more capeshit."
[deleted]
"They really should have ended it after End Game. I know that's easier said than done when you have something as big as the MCU, but they could have at least worked on smaller projects."
"You should treat yourself to watching The Last Knight. It's a fantastically terrible film that is almost incomprehensible. It's like if 3 unrelated scripts were smashed together, and the transformers chaos was added on top of that. It honestly might be my favourite of the franchise, not because it's good (it's not), but because it makes the most baffling decision every chance it gets.

Rise of the Beasts may not have been great, but it was at least coherent in its plot and characterisation."
"Beast Wars wasn't a masterpiece or anything, but it was a solid turn your brain off movie.  And way better than the Bay films.  By the third one, they became basically unwatchable."
The biggest issue with One was the first trailer completely turning away the fans. The second trailer was fantastic but by then it was too late and the fans never bothered watching until it was released on streaming shortly after release and they learned via word of mouth that it was actually incredible. 
"...I think you're talking about two different types of die-hard fan. You're talking about die-hard *comics* fans, they're talking about die-hard *MCU* fans."
Living stereotype of what people think a comic book fan acts like
"I don’t think it really matters, Guardians were D tier hero’s if that and the movie made them huge. 

Mr Terrific is also a nobody and is getting really popular. He will probably get his own movie or show."
Tbf that didn't used to matter (remember guardians of the galaxy). The fantastic 4 is also a pretty famous group
"Marvel will need to do some sort of massive reboot. There is no way around it. Even if they lay off the TV shows, which they definitely are doing after the current ones wrap production, this franchise will soon be 40 something movies (across nearly 20 years) big and risk collapsing under its own weight."
"Fantastic Four is pretty much standalone, with no dependencies on anything else MCU. So a good one to see, and a good movie in general, if you haven’t been watching since Endgame."
"Same here. Endgame felt like the natural stopping point for me. The more content that gets pumped out for a brand, the more diluted it feels. The MCU could literally make the Godfather part 2 of superhero movies, but it would still be a tough ask for me to go see it because it’s preceded by 36 other movies in the franchise."
"I mentioned this before, but not having an Avengers film or a similar crossover hurt them hard. Even Thunderbolt wasn’t really that as it was a bunch of side characters coming together.

They really could’ve done with a Kang Avengers movie somewhere in Phase 4 or 5."
Recommend at least watching Guardians 3. Fantastic movie that closes the current storyline. 
"Luckily Fantastic 4 doesn’t have this issue, and Thunderbolts isn’t reliant on and of the previous content.

Honestly I don’t really get that complaint with Marvel. They usually do a fine job reintroducing characters so that their movies are pretty standalone"
"This. I love Spidey but that movie really only works if you see it in a packed theater of fans. The actual plot is a total mess and is frankly pretty stupid at best. 

Someone pointed out to me that unless you've seen every single live-action Spider-man movie, No Way Home makes absolutely zero sense and doesnt work at all. That's definitely true."
I really dislike that and the last Deadpool. They are just nostalgia bait and aren't very good once you really look at them objectively.
"i agree, it was my least favourite of the 3. But people love spiderman, it will make a ton of money"
Deadpool and Wolverine isn't a good indicator
"Ehhh, I partially agree with you.  I think a major part of the ""Superhero fatigue"" has to do with there not being much else.  I mean look at how well Barbie and Opp did.  They were actually something else done fairly well that people went out to see.  So I think there is a little bit of frustration out there that aside from Hollywood shoveling out bad Superhero movies one after another.  People are craving other options, that are just as big.  Hell mission impossible is even something people are tired of.  Aside from that did we even get another huge release this summer?"
"I'm perfectly fine with them making new stories because different mediums just require different things. 

The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, and a bunch of the other great superhero movies are their own stories and are great."
Same here. I'm a little sad about that cause I read a lot of comics so these movies should be up my alley but I've really lost interest the last few years. Thought F4 would revitalize that but nope...
"Not to be George Costanza about it, but going to the cinema is an increasingly costly expenditure in an increasingly costly time. 

Personally, these films simply no longer possess the quality to justify it unlike big films like Dune or whatever Nolan is cooking. 

Disney are still getting my money, just not as much as they could."
"I loved when she said ""Bob , I know you, this isn't you""

She knew him for like 2 days at that point lol"
So writing quality wasn’t a factor in the first place?
I’m getting downvoted but Mister Fantastic >!thought that transporting the Earth was the best way to deal with Galactus!< Seriously? The smartest man in the world came up with this plan? Three films into Marvel’s ‘Quality First’ scheme?
"They were both pretty solid movies. Not masterpieces, but solid 7.5-8/10."
"Basically everything they have done beyond the actual comics is straight trash.  They keep pushing F4 and it never works.  Movies, shows, cartoons, nothing hits and it is time to give up.  Sometimes you cannot translate a thing from page to screen. 50+ years of flops should be enough."
"Comic book fans know they’re upper tier, but for general audiences there’s been 2 bad iterations, no animated series, and no games. Couple that with a run of mediocre MCU movies and that’s not really a winning formula, as much as I enjoy the characters."
"Most people dont know them, their previous movies have failed"
They’re B tier for normies
"Oh I agree! And of the 3 Marvel movies this year, fantastic four was the one that had the best chance to catch fire, but didn't. They definitely want to find the reset button."
"You could just google it. According to google, it’s on trend. Billion dollar movies aren’t normal you get a few a year. The difference was pre-covid marvel captured a huge chunk of these. 5-10 is normal and we’re actually trending up coming out of covid. Yes theater culture is not the same as once was, but the problem here is marvel.

In 2024, seven films surpassed the $700 million mark at the worldwide box office, including ""Inside Out 2"", ""Deadpool & Wolverine"", and ""Moana 2"".
In 2023, four films achieved this milestone: ""Barbie"", ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" and ""Oppenheimer"".
In 2019, 11 films broke the $700 million barrier: ""Avengers: Endgame"", ""The Lion King"", ""Frozen II"", ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", ""Captain Marvel"", ""Toy Story 4"", ""Joker"", ""Aladdin"", ""Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker"", ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"", and ""Ne Zha"". "
"No it’s Eddie’s actor, Joseph Quinn."
"That’s not long at all lmao, I walk 7min. to my local grocery store every day"
Wym? (Why ya mad?)
When was this strictly an American thing?
"I wonder where it stems from, because in my experience (not judging) it really is predominantly the Americans."
When was abbreviation usage only an American thing?
The green screen and CGI made the film look cheap and amateurish.
"F1, the brad Pitt movie, not F4."
it's not even close to true story. there has been nothing close to it. people are just making wild comparisons to real figures with no basis. it's a true original fictional story
"I 100% agree, but you don’t appreciate how modern Hollywood works. There can never be an end to a franchise. And it’s not just the fat cat, out of touch, executives pushing it either. Entire cottage industries are built around servicing and producing these large blockbusters. There is always going to be a push from either ego, money, or shareholders to do more with an IP. But without finality, there’s no nostalgia, there no fandom that can idolize it, there’s simply what’s next and it’s never as good as what’s past. 

It’s an ouroboros and it’s sad to see."
"Agreed. Not ended the mcu. But built it up slower over another 10 or so year period for the next generation.  
If they had done 3 or 5 Disney shows that actually led to something then movies that actually got sequels then they could've built it into another saga instead of relying on nostalgia and rdj"
"There’s been one truly good Marvel films since, Guarsians three, and the rest have been mediocre to awful."
"As I mentioned in another comment. Guardians was pre-end game and tying in to Thanos. Also, the marketing for those movies was great! Excellent sound track, Gunn's weird, fun sense of humor. 

And not sure what your point is with Mr. Terrific. He wasn't introduced in his own film like Eternals or Shang Chi, he debuted in one of the strongest DC properties which happened to be directed by James Gunn, one of the strongest comic book directors and even so, I'm not certain he could carry a movie on his own yet. Great character, but probably works best in an ensemble piece."
"Guardians was pre-Endgame and had a ton of Thanos tie-ins to help sell it, the fact it was a great movie and was really well marketed did the rest.

Fantastic Four has already been done poorly twice. I haven't seen it and have heard they pulled off the alt 1960s world, but as an MCU casual, the trailers were not selling it for me. Go watch the Guardians 1 trailer. It just looks fun and crazy."
"There’s very strong odds that they are aiming directly for that with the next two Avengers films.

If I had to make a bet today, the 2027 Avengers film will reboot the series to allow for better integration with the X-Men. I also expect that if the two 2026 films are well-received and trendy, we’ll see a big wave of people decide to catch up on all the films they missed and suddenly the multiverse saga will see a resurgence of favorability.

I could totally be wrong though."
"I wonder if they should have made more in the marketing of the fact that F4 has basically no connection to the rest of the MCU, and requires no prior knowledge. Instead it feels like they focused on teasing how its going to connect in the future, which I think was the wrong angle."
"It feels less like a film franchise and more like a long running soap opera. 

Miss a few, and it’s hard to catch up and jump back in. 

I’ll stick around for Spidey."
"The backstories for the characters in thunderbolts come from black widow, falcon and the winter soldier, ant man 2, and Hawkeye. It probably makes sense without watching those, but it’s also probably pretty confusing to see all these characters and not know who they are"
"Yeah, and even if you watch them it still doesn't make sense. They heal them... send them back... and they're back in their position and time to die lol? How is that saving them?"
Deadpool was literally just one huge cameo with zero care if the story was actually good.
Completely agree. It's kinda sad that they made the most money out of all these Marvel movies recently
"How exactly isn’t it a good indicator? Even if you have criticisms about the story, general audiences loved the movie and it made a ton of money."
"I mean, that’s prime comic book character logic."
"2 films, Cap 4 was part of the old strategy."
Far from the only time in the movie supposedly intelligent characters caught the idiot ball. Worst case I've seen since Prometheus.
"I mean when a giant cosmic god being is coming to eat your planet in a month, how many options do you really have to save it that aren’t completely absurd? It’s a ridiculous solution sure, but you’re ignoring the fact that the problem is also equally ridiculous lol if not moreso. They tried the sensible thing first, to try and bargain with him. It didn’t work. So they had to go bigger."
"Would put the 2/3 of thunderbolts i saw at at s solid 4/10. Awful dialogue, aimless and unfunny despite its best efforts. Characters too were unlikable and not in a cool villain way."
The best Fantastic Four movie is The Incredibles. The second best Fantastic Four movie is the Incredibles 2. Maybe they need to get Brad Bird to direct the next Fantastic Four movie...
"I think most people know them, I just think most people don't give a shit about them because they've never had a good movie. The general public didn't give a shit about Iron Man either until RDJ played him in a very strong film."
2019 was a historical box office. Great time to be a major studio exec
You're talking to the reddit crowd lmao

/s"
Now I’m really wondering if wym actually means that or if it’s “what you mean”. Lol.
Oh shoot. Apparently I can’t read. I’ll edit my post.
[deleted]
Especially not one with the momentum they had.  There was no way on earth they were going to just stop making content with all the money they raked in.
"Yeah I think the big issue is it stopped feeling organic. I think they’d have been better off not jumping directly into a new saga and instead taking a path more like Gunn has with the DCU — make movies based on the best scripts you have, see what heroes and stories gain momentum, and build on them. From there they could figure out how to bring all of that together which would be when the new saga took shape.

My understanding is that is probably closer to how it worked the first time around. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen it mentioned a few times that even when they had the Thanos post credit scene after Avengers they still hadn’t actually decided on that as a direction, it was more just meant as a nod to fans and they eventually decided to roll with it (likely because it was so positively received)."
As exciting an idea it was for the new TV shows/mini-series to be fully connected to the mcu it really hurt things. The Defenders stuff on Netflix was hit or miss quality wise but having all the streaming shows be in their own pocket of the mcu with its own crossovers and team ups was the way to go.
"I think they should've ended it, TBH. Endgame wraps up a 10 year long story. It *feels* like the end. At the very least they should've taken a year or two off of Marvel content. As in complete and utter silence on any and all Marvel projects. No new content, no roadmaps, nothing. And only then come back with more movies."
"Shang Chi was pretty solid up until the third act, at which point it was just generic (at worst)."
Feel the same.
"Im honestly starting to think that the X Factor really is Gunn. The Guardians trilogy is probably the most solid and well received trilogy of the franchise. So much of the cosmic elements of the MCU like the infinity stones were introduced by him. If Disney hadn’t dropped the ball, I could definitely see him steering the ship in a better direction post endgame"
"I just think that you don’t need to already know and like the characters at the start of the movie, thats what the movie is for"
"I mean, they are powered individuals who work for Valentina and they say as much in the movie. The only movie (other than Endgame I guess) I really think it’s crucial for understanding/enjoying it is Black Widow which I admit is tough to watch."
Um cause everything else has failed outside of it and it's a unique and different movie in that it's mostly nostalgia bait with the other heroes from old movies?
The smartest man in the world. Moving the Earth would not only be extremely dangerous for the people on Earth and how does it solve the problem of hiding from Galactus? He found Earth once. He can find it again.
My mistake. I was confused because Captain Falcon was so great.
"No, lots of people in Fantastic Four did stupid things. But stupidity isn’t justified by being common"
"The original option was stealing Galactus' magic space gun (Ultimate Nullifier) and pointing it in the direction of his face to make him back off. So yeah pure and very literal plot device. 

I don't know about Lee but Jack Kirby at least was making a story about God and Judgement Day... reasonable options kinda do not exist in that scenario."
"Right? The world hates russians right now..lets make the next avengers russian!

Braindead or brainwashing move."
People knew Iron Man.  At the time people went to go see it to see how they could make a movie out of it.  Remember all of these special effects/CGI were being used in a new way at the time.
I weep for the destructions cars have done to North Americans.
was /s really necessary?
"Its ok, your comment will probably end up ringing true in 10 years once the Formula One cinematic universe is on its 4th movie lol"
"Just the crash. He never came back from that. Entire story is fictional or ""original"", albeit generic and unrealistic."
"I 100% agree. 

**spoilers**

So many people were confounded that Wanda was evil in Dr. Strange 2. So many people were uninterested in The Marvels because they didn't know who Monica Rambeau or Kamala Khan were. People didn't know who Elijah was in Captain America: Brave New World, which made that movie even harder to connect with. And what's going to happen when casual fans see Hulk's son show up in a movie? The idea of not knowing about these types of things certainly got some people to subscribe to D+ to stay in the loop, but they lost a lot of the casual movie fans over it. A lot of my friends and family really liked the MCU and we'd go see all of the movies together, but they didn't like it enough to subscribe to a whole new streaming service, and even if they did, they are busy and don't have time to watch a dozen new shows. 

And some of the shows were big enough flops that we'll probably never get follow-ups on stuff that should be really major. Like, Emilia Clarke's character from the Nick Fury show flew off at the end of the series with the powers of multiple avengers, including Captain Marvel's! She's a major force out there now, but we'll probably never see her again, and if we do, all the people who didn't watch the show are going to be completely baffled that there's a flying skrull with Groot powers.

I'm admittedly a sucker for all this stuff. I even enjoy the bad stuff. But the drop in quality is clear and the frustrations are real. The criticisms I've heard are pretty much all valid and I completely understand why they've lost so many people."
"Ending it with just the fight with the dad would have been so great. 

But no we needed a cgi monster battle."
"Agreed, Gunn's movies stand on their own. Again, go back and watch the original trailer for Guardians 1. The one where they are all arrested and John C Reilly is reading off who they all are and what they're in for. It just looks fun as fuck. Even if it had no tie-ins to the MCU and was just a crazy Sci-Fi adventure film, it looks like a fun movie to watch.

Now watch the latest Fantastic Four Trailers. They aren't bad, but there is nothing that feels fun and interesting outside of the 1960s retro-future setting. The characters all feel muted or flat compare with Guardians. Nothing screams, I need to see this in theaters."
"Reed has rebuilt the multiverse, teleporting Earth ain't nuthin. Some great Plan A shit-that-won't-work-out really.

And *the universe* is a big place, Galactus generally moves about it pretty slowly and randomly. Possibly because he's not actually into killing worlds for fun. At any as the Devourer of Worlds not galactic superclusters it is actually quite reasonable to suppose he would never find Earth again unless he could track the move in some way. 

Or he only finds it a billion years from now when humanity is a space faring empire. 

Or you just ya know teleport it again."
"The Ultimate Nullifier macguffin is honestly some ridiculous bullshit too, way moreso than something like teleporting the Earth. You’re telling me that in deus ex machina fashion The Watcher tells the F4 about a weapon that just so happens to be the one thing able to erase Galactus from existence, and just so happens to be on Galactus’ home planet, and is able to help the F4 get it so they can threaten him with it? That always came off to me like the writers couldn’t really think of a good way to beat Galactus either so they just came up with some plot contrivance to end the story. No way that would’ve translated well into the movie any better than what we got."
"I had literally never heard of Iron Man. I went to see it because the trailer looked cool and the reviews and word of mouth were good. How would someone who wasn't into comics have come to be interested in Iron Man without the movie? I don't get the impression the 90s TV show was a big hit at the time - I certainly have no memory of it even existing, and I was in the right age bracket."
F1:4
"Funny thing is, when Disney announced that all future MCU shows will be canon people warned that the average viewer isn't going to go through all that extra homework, stop watching and will likely never come back because of the immense homework they'd have to go through after skipping multiple movies + TV series but they all got dismissed by the hardcore fans as doomers. 


Yet now here we are. "
"At the very least, the nonsense with the monster could've been foreshadowing for Kang and the multiverse nonsense. Make the portal a link to another universe or something and the monster implied to be Kang.

And yeah, still have the fight be just between him and the dad. There was no need for a big flashy final fight like what we got."
"Dude me and my friend cried when that cool ass dragon showed up, it was fun as hell"
"How much power did he need to teleport that egg not-very-far? He would need more power than the earth has to teleport the whole earth across the galaxy. 

It’s way more plausible, and still dumb, to have Sue turn the planet invisible."
"I mean I'll take any excuse for Jack Kirby [to draw this majesty incarnate](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/4/40/Worldship_%28Taa_II%29_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_49_0001.jpg) actually and yes I actually do think it makes sense for someone to keep their Achilles Heel somewhere in their possession. The safest place for something is the place you can check regularly but discretely. 

Still I also don't dismiss your point out of hand. 

Thing is though how do you defeat a transcendent space god? I don't think there IS a good answer to that its always gotta be some convenient ex machina device, or turning their power against them, or some chicanery like oh you can loop time but they can't."
"OK, I was talking about the general audience, not every single person"
I feel like their big mistake was making the shows mandatory homework for the movies. The shows should've had their own storyline.
Username fits
"Egg? I wouldn't know I haven't seen the movie. 

You want to talk about power concepts though if you are teleporting something then distance/energy isn't super relevant, you've found some cheat code in reality to accomplish a feat that under relativity would require infinity energy to move a single proton instantly.

And look you don't like Science as Magic that's really fair enough but Reed Richards is absolutely a magical wizard man not someone you should expect anything realistic out of."
"The point about keeping your Achilles heel close does make sense. And I completely agree with your last paragraph, which ties back into my original argument against StillStanding_96’s comment that the idea of teleporting the Earth away is stupid. It’s an impossible situation that requires an impossible solution, whether that be using a macguffin like the Ultimate Nullifier, receiving divine intervention from The Watcher, or hatching a batshit crazy plan like teleporting the Earth to have a chance at survival. Even my gripes about the Ultimate Nullifier plot line are moreso about the convenience of it all in a writing sense rather than the actual plan itself."
"So am I. Again, why would a person who wasn't a comic book fan have been interested in Iron Man without the film? Where else did they know about him from?"
?
"I think it wiped out the entire building's energy to teleport the egg a few meters, so yeah I agree with /u/StillStanding_96 point about the power need."
Very well known character
"The smurfs trailer is literally the worst trailer I have ever seen - it made me actively root for the movie to fail it looked so bad.  I'm not sure that's ever happened before.  I can't believe it even made 10m after that.

Glad to see Superman doing well, it's the best DC movie I've seen in ages (not a high bar I admit) and was actually enjoyable."
How many time will they try to make “Smurfs” happen?
">In Japan, history was made. ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Infinity Castle*** debuted with a colossal 5.9 billion yen, which is around $36.5 million (some estimates have it at $39.7 million). This is the biggest debut in the country's history, and Hollywood chose to avoid releasing anything in close proximity. This is set for one of the best runs in the history of the country.

Might as well write off the Japanese market for the rest of the year. 

Yeah you might make some money but Demon Slayer will be dominating for months to come."
"Well I don't want to see Eddington flop because I think Ari Aster is one of the best directors out there. But I can only imagine how completely inaccessible it is. I love his movies but they are 100% not for everyone. 

Glad Superman is doing good though."
Seeing Superman Wednesday! My wife finally got time off and she asked to watch it with me. Totally empty theater so far so I think I was likely to miss it if I don't go this week
i genuinely didnt even know they were making another smurfs movie
Whoever thought making a sequel/ requel to ikwydls and then dropping it between superman and f4 should be fired.
Superman was F’n great and I don’t care what the haters say.
"> The sequel opened with just $71 million and capped out at $71 million,

There’s a number wrong in this Smurfs info."
Just saw superman today. Loved how Gunn just dropped us into the world.
"OP, I don’t know if you wrote this post yourself, but I liked all the info. Pretty much read the entire thing."
I enjoyed Eddington. It was an uncomfortable watch (akin to Whiplash) but it's hard for me to recommend it to people. It's gonna have trouble finding fans. It's an intense film with a flimsy plot but a compelling set of circumstances. Characters were intentionally unlikable except maybe for Pedro's. Def got a few laughs out of me and those also in the audience but it's not something you'd need to see on the big screen.
"That's a lot of information. I don't know much, but I know Empire magazine gave Smurfs 1 star in their review. They don't give many movies 1 star ⭐"
"I had no idea Smurfs had any kind following in big screen. Nevermind about going to sequels. Now if these fucking mosquitos would stop biting me...oh yeah,surprised about Eddington also. Had positive words before wide release and seems like fell flat after?

Edit: how the hell does f1 keep doing well?"
"Down in Australia we saw the top 5 remain exactly the same as last week, where everything got a ""school holiday bump"" last week giving single digit % drops or with Smurfs/Elio/Lilo and Stitch +% gains, and continued to hold well this week as a result of the effect continuing. 

I Know What You Did Last Summer opened in 6th down here and I'm still baffled about the reboot as it had one well regarded movie, one worse and one direct to video. But opening in 6th still gave it the award of the 5th highest horror opening of the year, so not great but could have been much worse.  

For downunder context:  
1. 28 Years Later - $2,566,690  
2. Nosferatu - $2,323,723  
3. Final Destination: Bloodlines - $2,037,639  
4. Sinners - $1,340,786  
5. I Know What You Did Last Summer - $1,052,245  

So beating out titles like Until Dawn, Heart Eyes, The Monkey, Wolf Man, Companion, and M3GAN 2.0.  

Not a super exciting weekend but we will see what the third and final MCU movie does for 2025 next week."
"For as much as people online seem to bash the JW movies, they sure do rack up at the BO."
I thought Eddington was fantastic. Very thought provoking. I'm not surprised to see it flop but I think it  is an important movie
Absolutely telling that elio (not watched it but a new IP - haven't heard great things mind you) is yet to hit 100m and a remake of an old Disney film is the first to crack 1b this year.
Eddington flopping is tragic.
Its good news for taste that Smurfs and IKWYDLS did poorly.
"Paramount seems to have given up entirely on Smurfs domestically, to the point that marketing the SpongeBob short attached to the film as a “lost episode” wasn’t enough to save it (which shows you how desperate they were)."
"If Eddington was made 20 years later I think it would be interesting to look back and for others to see what happened, it's been what 5 years since the pandemic. Everyone who cares remembers and everyone else the movie isn't for. I mean it feels really preaching to the choir rn. Why would I watch it when I can just remember?"
"Movie geeks are going to be pissed but the Aster double flop has to be mentioned. For the life of me, I can’t see what others see in BIA. I was always going to see and am excited about Eddington, but my buddy told me the first half was rough (second half he gave 5 stars), but if you cant get people in the door, let alone make money off a movie starring that foursome, what are we doing here? Would also probably help if it wasn’t released during the peak of the summer blockbusters with another Pedro Pascal movie imminent."
"While Eddington is not my favorite Aster movie, It was a fun watch and it's a shame it's doing poorly."
Who keeps funding smurfs movies? It's basically a dead franchise now. Also Eddington almost had little to no marketing. And Superman won't stay on top much longer with the fantastic four coming to theaters this week.
The problem with I Know What You Did Last Summer is Sony decided to revive it despite the TV series flopped. Scream TV series at least got 3 seasons
I swear they didn’t promote iskwdls
"I'm not sure who IKEYDLS is for. 


It didn't have the cultural impact of Scream, the killer isn't iconic (or even really memorable), and the cast aren't exactly a draw."
"Unfortunately for Smurfs, their time has passed. The simplicity and care from the original series just doesn't resonate well with today kids, and the attempt at making them ""hip and cool"" was pure cringe. It's a movie that doesn't appeal to anyone.

*Superman* is looking to not being a blockbuster, despite the raving reviews. Same thing happened to *Thunderbolts*. We will see how *First Steps* tracks, it is also tepid, then we can say the era of superhero movies is over. Again."
I tried to go see Eddington during the day yesterday but it was only showing after 6pm. It only had one showtime at the theater closest to me.
Do we think stitch has a chance of taking dom from minecraft? I think it's still a toss up.
Eddington will never be a flop but whatever
Superman was really good. I was surprise how much I like it and how funny it was.
[deleted]
"Can someone do that “Hollywood Accounting” magic to steal all the money Superman, Jurassic World, and every other film in the top 10 made and give it to Eddington?"
“Flop” = non commercial film doesn’t sell a ton of tickets? Not everything is about money.
400th redo of a superhero character and Man of Steel was a far superior movie.
I couldn’t believe what I was seeing with that trailer. It was all smurfs dancing/emoting and the dialogue was just “oh boy we really smurfed up this time” “get ready to Smurf”
"That trailer is like a parody wow...


Looks painful "
"It's so cliche the most typical way to play those movies is put them in the real world, and we have seen that so much it's getting so damn bland.

Even with better writing and jokes, it would still be something we have seen like 20 times at least if not more from former franchises."
"Using a silly word in place of a swear word is pretty par for the course for animated movie trailers that want to seem edgy, but I swear they use “smurf” in place of a swear word like four times. Made me want to bash my head against a wall."
The Smurfs trailer looks so bad that they should give you free food for suffering through it. It is literally the best time to get up and use the bathroom before your movie starts.
Yeah but did you know that Rihanna is Smurfette?
I think The Cat in the Hat trailer is somehow worse.
"Damn... I was sure it was a troll trailer at first.

horrible Smufs trailer"
"The smurfings will continue, until morale improves."
The 2011 film made over $500 million worldwide and its sequel made just under $350 million. It definitely happened last decade.
"I give it 5 more years before some executive decides to reboot it with another popstar.

""Trust me, this will finally put them back on track."""
This isn't the first time Rihanna has really Smurfed it up.
The animation looked HORRIBLE too. Like they spent a couple hundred dollars max on it.
"Stop trying to make Smurfs happen Hollywood, it’s not gonna happen!"
"Why wouldn't they, the smurfs are peak fetch right now"
Damn that's insane Demon Slayer opened up as much as DBS Broly grossed.
"Interestingly, I saw it this past weekend and think Eddington is probably his more accessible movie. Maybe it’s the political undertones that are putting people off. Also, I’m not seeing a lot of marketing for it."
"As interesting as the premise sounded, I watched the trailer and thought “who’s going to be excited to see this?” I didn’t put the trailer in front of any of my theater’s movies because I genuinely thought it would bum people out to be transported back to a time when all we had was consuming 2020 through our phones.

Not surprised everyone at my theater’s come out of it hating it. A society-wide trauma from which we haven’t really recovered does not make for a movie people will enjoy much."
Word of mouth and awards season will be Eddington's friend. Saw it Thursday and the more I think about it the more I like it. Feel like a lot of people will probably feel the same way.
Aster seems like the type of guy that will always have steady work somehow even if he will never be a box office money maker.
It almost feels like he doesn’t want people to see his movies. They’re only for him
Eddington would have done amazing if not for Beau. I feel like that made him seen inaccessible but eddington is awesome.
"My wife loved it and she doesn't really like superhero movies, so I hope your wife enjoys it as well!"
"I went twice - once with my wife and a week later with my kids. We all loved it, really fun movie."
[deleted]
Christ I’ve seen that trailer 48 times in theaters.
And I didn’t know they were making another “I know what you did…” movie. This post is honestly the first I’ve heard of it.
"It literally just worked for Final Destination. But that series was always bigger and has a much better premise. Plus the reviews for Bloodlines were excellent (and rightly so, wildly fun movie)."
Not the same crowd at all 
Thanks. Fixed.
"It’s a lot to take in quickly, but ultimately I think the movie and the franchise is going to be better off for it. The DC reboot can’t afford some long slow windup, they’ll lose the public interest, keep it plowing on at a breakneck pace. "
"Starting a couple years into adult Superman and a couple weeks into the plot was brilliant, and from there the movie hits the gas and does not let up til its over. It was a way better way to immerse in a new(-ish) universe, without plodding scenes of exposition."
[deleted]
"I told my husband that I wouldn’t have watched it in the cinema if it was another origin story. 

At this point, we don’t need origin stories for any of the “anchor” supers - Superman, Spiderman, and Batman. Everyone knows where they came from. Just tell a story."
"Yep, it's all written by me. I appreciate it!"
Brad Pitt brings in lots of different people and lots of people like F1 as a sport
I mean at the end of the day who doesn’t wanna see dinosaurs mess things up
Dinosaurs.
"Jurassic Park movies may, for most of the part, be total shit besides the first one, but if history has taught us anything, Dinosaur movies will always rake in the big bucks."
"Because online communities dont represent shit, and never have. Reddit in particular always circlejerked about i.e. transformers, call of duty, etc., tons of things across tons of mediums, when in in the actual real world, thee amount of people who enjoy those things absolutely dwarf these complaining communities."
"Yeah that was the type of movie I thought immediately upon seeing the trailer and thinking, no matter what the quality will be, it is going to flop. Still need to see it myself though."
"Elio's problem was not that it was not an original IP, can we please stop repeating that viral shame-campaign malarkey. It was cute, but it just wasn't that great or original a story, especially compared to other Pixar fare."
"This sounds so snobbish, especially because IKWYDLS still has that fun slasher feel to it. 

Smurfs does look like one of the worst films out there though, like a real life version of Kool-Aid from the Studio."
And yet Superman is basically a childish poorly-written movie and is getting all the praise and attention.
"Holy shit, Smurfs is out! I gotta see that movie. The first one was like the Godfather for kid animated movies. I hope it's playing at my local Imax!"
You'll get your money when you fix this damn door.
"In the context of movies, that term has everything to do with money..."
"It’s a weird space to be in, auteur film gets released in the middle of summer, gets lukewarm critical reception and makes no money either. Not like it had high expectations but it didn’t really meet any expectations"
[deleted]
Wait until this guy hears about James Bond
"To be fair I thought the Minecraft trailer was the worst trailer I've seen in a long time, and I'm a pretty big fan of the game, but apparently it resonated with kids and was super successful so who knows with these things."
"Oh really?  Personally, I didn't like the cat in the hat trailer, but it didn't fill me with visceral hatred like the Smurfs one."
"Yeah all of those movies flopped domestically so it's really easy for American audiences to write off the Smurfs completely, but that IP is huge overseas."
[deleted]
Battleship (2012) ⚓🚢
Hot damn that's some good perspective to add. That's insane.
The previous Demon Slayer movie (Mugen Train) is currently the highest grossing Japanese film of all time.
Not really a fan but I’ll say that franchise is extremely well animated
"Demon Slayer is insanely popular. Its manga sales are incredible as well and I think a large part is that it is relatively short. The manga finished in 2020, when the first movie was released. So if you got interested in it, you could just go get a completed series/series that was about to wrap up and you could experience the ending as it came out.

It sits just below Dragon Ball and Naruto in volume sales, with a fraction of the number of volumes. And sits comfortably ahead of other recent popular franchises like AOT, JJK, MHA. Those three+ demon slayer are the only manga started past 2010 (and I am being nice to AOT and including it as it is 2009) that are 100 million+ volumes sold club. 

Frieren is the highest that started after 2020, and it is 'only' at 30 million currently 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga"
It is easily his most accessible film. I loved it and would rank it 2nd in his filmography. I feel like it’ll do nicely on PVOD and a streaming service. I hope studios don’t give up on Ari because he’s my favorite director out there right now.
I’m sure the ads are targeted but I’ve seen so much Eddington marketing on my social media
"I don’t know if I’d say it’s more accessible than Midsommar or Hereditary, especially because horror fans seem more open to different ideas."
[deleted]
"I think directors like Aster are generally fine with heady films that don't make a lot of money, anyway. Look at Robert Eggers and Northman. Studios are seemingly forgiving about well-made films that don't put asses in seats because they know those movies will have longevity, so they don't get immediately sent to movie jail. Denis Villeneuve and BR2049 as well. That didn't really seem to hurt him or kill his future prospects despite not lighting up the box office. Because the studios know the guy is extremely competent."
He was born to make additions to the Criterion Collection lol
Your children didn't care that an underwear mogal who stopped releasing music a decade ago is the voice in a movie?!
IKWYD doesn't have the critical acclaim of Scream or the fan base of Final Destination. It was already a hard sell.
There’s a whole lot more to success than just getting that target audience.
Why do you think that? There's a very good chance people into slasher-lite like IKWYD are fams of at least Marvel or DC and horror fans probably don't give a damn about it. I know me and my gf are more horror fans than superheroes and we grew up on IKWYD but it's not even in the conversation.
"Yeah, the thing about DC comics is that they're *weird* and you just kind of have to be along for the ride or else every movie would just be hours of exposition."
"And its not like it didn't do his origin. You could have never seen any superman media before and you get the story. 

He is an alien that was raised by farmers in Kansas, his home world was destroyed, he moved to a city and became a superhero and has a secret identity where he is a reporter. He recently started dating a co-worker who knows his secret identity. All of that is told and shown within the first act of the movie. 

I am not saying that full origin stories are bad or anything, but it is weird how there is this idea that you need to see everything about a character. Because that is not how a lot of stories are told. You don't always see how a character grew up. How they got their job. How they met all the people in their life. We can in fact just start at the main story."
"Just as Top Gun Maverick, people like it when things go fast"
"The people in the Jurassic World universe apparently. “No one is interested in dinosaurs anymore”…

I can forgive the plot of Rebirth, but for the love of christ, stop saying no one is interested in dinosaurs as a way for directors to create their own dinosaurs via hybrids or mutants."
"Literally this is why my wife wanted to see it. I’m not a *big* Jurassic Park fan, but quite enjoy the first movie. The Lost World, 3, and all the Jurassic World trilogy were mostly terrible, but oh well, I’ll watch a new one. To be honest, it was far better than the Chris Pratt ones, to me."
"It was in reference to its direct ""competition"" in a remake of an older IP being one of the first films to break 1b whilst it struggles to get anybody in seats.

I don't care how good or bad it is, when the cash grab remake is making over 10 fold at the box office, that's what they will make more of.

Original pixar and Disney ips have been struggling for a long time with more misses than hits."
"I have a 4 year old so I ended up seeing it opening weekend. It doesent feel like a Pixar movie, it feels like a Sony movie and not one of their more recent awesome fare.

It’s hard to reconcile it with something like Wall-E when looking at what Pixar can do with an science fo theme. Everything about the alien emissaries and alien father plot is just so bland and boring. For the plot to even work they had to make every other character in space so incredibly stupid, like how do these creatures even survive on their own.


I hope Pixar can find what they lost along the way, I really do, even as recently as Onward they had a spark that’s just.. gone now. "
"I’m okay with sounding snobbish; IKWYDLS is shameless, soulless cash-grab nostalgia-bait that only shows how desperate studios are that they are now rehashing movies that were meh to begin with. Are they reviving Urban Legend next? Haha"
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Fuck your lame Snyderverse.
i've been reading poetry lately
"I think the budgets are getting too high to be that black and white about it - did the last Mission Impossible flop because it *only* made $600 million, but needed $800 million (or whatever) to break even? At that point, the issue isn’t people going to see it, it’s the absolutely insane budget that doesn’t set the film up to succeed financially."
"No, it doesn’t. Would you call “The Big Lebowski” a flop? “Children of Men”? “Fight Club”? 

It’s a really ignorant approach to art. Don’t be an absolute goof."
Unlike Man of Steel
"Minecraft is the type of movie kids will drag their parents to. The Smurfs is a brand kids aren't aware of, and the movie looked so bad that parents don't want to take their kids to see it."
Minecraft had the benefit of being the first film in the series. Who even remembers how many Smurf movies there have been.
"The difference is kids. Kids wanted to see the Minecraft movie.

Who wants to see this Smurf movie?"
"I don't remember the being a shittier kids movie. But it still got my money, so I guess it did alright."
The full animated movie that came out a couple of years ago was a great little movie. I wish we got more of this instead of this 3rd reboot.
She is the right height.

Undertones? It’s about as subtle as getting hit in the face with a frying pan.

Just people remember a movie doesn’t mean they remember it fondly
"It's also so funny if you map it to real life. It'd be like saying nobody wants to go to the zoo anymore, we've all seen animals."
"To be fair:


If I was directing a Jurassic World movie I would want to make my own dinosaur. Fucking hell that's cool, I'd be kinda annoyed if I was the first one in a while who didn't get to!"
"Looking over Pixar's offerings lately its strikes me just how *old* many of them feel. 

Van wizards straight out of the eighties, Interstellar 2, a rom com between young adults, and dead man jazz? Those ain't kids movies no matter the cartoon paint job c'mon. Hell some of those are pretty long in the tooth for the Millennial parents. Luca according to a quick check is set in the 50s and certainly gave off that vibe focusing more on the zomg Italy then the whole sea monster thing in the marketing, and sure maybe that's old enough to be 'timeless' but it sure as hell ain't modern. 

And Elio might as well be there running around with that colander on his head. Boomers maybe had to do that sort of shit because they didn't have other options. I want to depict a lonely preteen space nerd today he isn't running around playing dress up and making rocket noises he's binge watching space videos on his phone in the sweet sanctum of his room. 

Now mind I haven't been inspired to see any of these so maybe there's something I missed but that's the marketing vibe Pixar has been putting off."
Don’t give them ideas
"Snyder’s movies were definitely worse, but this wasn’t anywhere near as good as it should’ve been. I was hoping that the new movie would showcase Gunn’s talent (as he showed in Marvel movies), but it felt like it was written by a 5 year old. It seems the original 1978 and 1980 movies are still the only definitive versions of the character."
"Yea it did. Its true that some movies have absurd budgets, but that's a completely separate topic. The actual term flop refers to profitability, not popularity."
"No i wouldn't? Technically Children of Men did not recoup its budget in a theatrical run, but regardless this is a post about the weekend Box Office and your only contribution to the discussion is ""not everything is about money"" after defining the word flop yourself.


This thread is about the money lol"
"The point was that there's a group who sees different things in trailers, not necessarily that it has a fan base of the same size."
"Yes, please stop taking great IP into the real world! It makes for god awful movies 95% of the time."
most of the fights dont follow that format at all youre lying
"I've heard adults say zoos are for children, as if no one over the age of 18 would wanna go see a giraffe. I always wanna go see a giraffe."
"I share the same interest you do in animals, but a crazy amount of adults have no interest in zoos or safaris"
"I guess the term always made it sound no one went to see the movie. Lots of popular movies flopping, these days."
This thread is about MOVIES. LOOK UP.
Crazy to think something as recognizable as Superman would be an “underdog” story but I’m so happy it’s done well. Completely deserves all its success
"The marketing for F4 was practically non-existent in my country, WAY different from Thunderbolts which was literally everywhere. I’m guessing Marvel made a sort of tactical decision to focus on the US audience and save on marketing?"
"International audiences really just don’t give a fuck about superheroes anymore, especially relatively legacy superheroes like Fantastic Four and Superman which haven’t had any recent amazing media appearances.

TBH I can’t really blame them. Many of them rely on American backdrops and culture, and Superheroes in general are kinda just like American mythology—and I can’t think of any time recently where it felt like international audiences were less enthusiastic to celebrate America."
I genuinely can't believe the like 9th sequel to Jurassic Park is beating a Superman movie.
Overseas isn’t really doing these big superhero blockbusters any favors. Didn’t they used to carry these movies?
"Safe to say, there is no Pedro Pascal fatigue."
Can't believe Jurassic Park is so successful 
"Jurassic World Rebirth was never in doubt, such a good movie 

Superman is brilliant 

HTTYD was nicely done

Can’t wait to see  F4 & F1 eventually"
Crazy to think F9 (2021) would leave such a legacy
Foreign audiences seem to be getting sick of our superhero movies. Superman and F4 both bombed internationally now.
It’s so weird I really liked Superman movie but I found the Fantastic 4 movie kinda meh.
"Supermam was wholesome and fun, so glad it’s doing well

Jurassic Park will always make money no matter what. I enjoyed it

I was disappointed by Fantastic Four, it was meh

I need to see F1 soon"
"Yeah down here in Australia, Fantastic Four was the 7th highest opening of the year so far, so while it was the highest MCU opening of 2025, it's still well behind what other titles are doing.  

Also I think Aussie audiences just don't care for the MCU anymore. I took the number of tickets sold opening weekends of all MCU movies in Australia (sometimes called Butts in Seats) broken down per year and it was the lowest attendance since 2011.  

Granted it still opened higher than any of the other Fantastic Four movies, but lets be honest apart from some great casting those movies are kinda terrible."
"No surprise, seems like the rest of the world is sick of superman, marvel and all the other american superhero stuff. Can’t speak for everyone but I’m just not interested in americans dressing up and pretending to be heroes and save everyone given they’re currently a hostile nation"
"F4 was fine. Not as good as Thunderbolts* and not even remotely as good as Superman.

A little frustrated that the climax was literally just >!pushing Galactus in a hole for someone else to eventually deal with!<"
Very happy to see F1 hit half a billion. Deserves every dollar it has made and continues to make.
The summer blockbusters are back but for some reason it feels like all of these movies failed to really overperform their expectations
"I really liked Superman, Fantastic 4 was aight. I've not bothered with Jurassic Park because the other JW films were shite."
"I have a theory that the international numbers are lower because other countries probably view that era of America as the enemy.

 Places like south America, China, Africa, eastern Europe, etc probably aren't going to have positive views of 1960s America"
"I'm surprised there weren't more of Pedro's many female fans who watched F4 this weekend. It's basically his first leading role in a major movie so you'd think they would turn out.

And colour me surprised that Superman will likely end up outgrossing F4. Not surprised though that Jurassic World: Rebirth will be the top grosser of the big three July releases. Dinosaurs!"
Seeing these numbers feels so sad because that Jurassic World movie was easily one of the worst movies I’ve seen in the last decade and Super man was really great
"I'm not in the US (and it was a morning showing), but I was the only person in the entire theater.  I loved it, but it's still unfortunate considering the quality of the movie."
"""Disappoints""

Give me a break"
"The movie is good but I can’t get ANY of my friends to go check it out even though they all dabble in going to superhero movies.  They are firmly out on Superman after getting burned by a decade of pisspoor Snyder films and have the impression that he’s just a boring overpowered character that can’t be interesting. 

I fully expect they’ll reluctantly throw it on randomly months from now on HBO Max and be like “hey that was actually pretty fun”"
[deleted]
Honestly I haven't really seen much marketing for f4 in the US compared to thunderbolts.
The only information I get from F4 is the Pedro's touching lmao.
I think with the rumored reboot of the MCU and this new DCU we will see the superhero fatigue set in and audience will go see these movies but they won’t be guaranteed 700million plus like before. Maybe in a few years it’ll be back to post Avengers pre Endgame levels of popularity but I think general audiences are worn out a bit.
"I feel they never really cared about non MCU phase 1-3 movies. In Australia, I only ever saw hype for Marvel.  I do wonder if they stopped for a bit after Endgame, figured out a new solid storyline for phase 4+ instead of some shitty fan service movies, if there would be the same fatigue."
"In a lot countries going to the movies is kinda expensive. 


Streaming services have conditioned people to understand they will be able to watch it at home soon enough on a service they already pay for.. plus with all the TV shows and the fact that a lot of these movies look cheaper and and shittier than they did 10 years ago I wonder if it has devalued the brand and people now look at them as a streaming product. 


I'm sure The Batman 2 will make a lot of money though. "
"Super hero’s are modern mythology or kinda ancient mythology in a way. 

America doesn’t have ancient mythology so superhero’s kinda replaced that void. But in countries like China they have stuff like nhe zah that fills that mythology void. "
"Batman and Spiderman do pretty well consistently. And Spiderman is set in New York, so undeniably American. 

I think Fantastic Four and Superman are just not very exciting characters. Snyder, for all his faults, at least tried to take the character in an unusual direction."
Superman especially is an American icon. America's reputation worldwide is not the same as it was back in the 70s
"At least from my circle yeah, the interest is just not there anymore for cape stuff."
"Jurassic Park movies have always been bigger hits than Superman. BvS is the only Superman movie to make more than *any* JP film, but it pales in comparison to what the JW movies were making at the time. Even the weakest JP movie (JP3) made more than its nearest contemporary, Superman Returns. 

So I’m not really sure why it’s unbelievable. It’s the 9th entry in a major franchise, compared to the 8th in a - at best - shaky franchise."
"Kids love dinosaurs. That’s why they keep making the story kid friendly. General audiences don’t care about superheroes they aren’t familiar with. To current generation, Iron Man is more popular than Superman."
It came out a week before it did during a major holiday weekend plus it has dinosaurs in it.
"Rebirth came out towards the start of the summer season with less competition and a few weeks to capitalize on that. Superman came out with summer in full swing when people might be more selective about what they see and might be on vacation. Not to mention, Superman has been a hard sell for the last 20 or so years. Superman Returns and Man of Steel did ok, but not huge numbers."
"It's a shame too bc Superman is an unmitigated blast, while JP kinda...sucks. Real bad."
I mean no one really saw Eddington and the MCU crowd probably didn't see Materialists. It's kind of hard to get fatigued on Pedro Pascal when you don't actually see most of the stuff that he's in
"Tell that to Eddingtons box office

/s"
"There is outside the US, or movie fans have never really cared that much about him it seems."
You can’t? People love dinosaurs.
"Every Jurassic Park movie has been successful, even the one that bafflingly spent more time on locusts than dinosaurs. It shouldn't really be that surprising that this one made money"
Summer blockbusters do well 
Kids love dinosaurs. Where else are you going to find decent/good CHI Dino's 
God F1 cooked. You've got to see it. 
When are they releasing F2 and F3?
"Really? What about Rebirth was good. Just tired, recycled material that has nothing new to say."
Hopefully F2 and F3 come out soon
"F1 is actually the best out of all of these, my favorite time in the theater so far this year."
Fantastic Four was so bad. The writing was just god awful.
Reed should have invented the Galactic Glock and blasted that helmet off Galactus's head.
F4 was probably the most comic-accurate MCU movie and I think some of the problems people have with it come from that. Your frustration with Galactus makes sense but also that's just how Galactus works in the comics.
"If they had >!killed or outright defeated Galactus, people would complain they nerfed Galactus too much and wasn't a credible threat. If they had had Franklin deux ex blow him up or crumple him or erase him, people would've whined about the F4 not beating him themselves. If Galactus defeated the F4, then people would bitch about the F4 being losers who can't beat their first cinematic villain.!<

The way it ended was the most sensible way to do it and was comic accurate."
"Thats really all you can do with Galactus, hes a force of nature"
"Didn’t Superman >!push Ultraman into a black hole?!<

I found the result pretty satisfying. Killing Galactus reduces the existential threat he presents. Being forced to create and use technology to move Galactus to the other side of the universe because he’s impossibly difficult to kill made sense to me."
It feels like the old fashioned 90s blockbusters Bruckheimer used to dabble in before he got sucked into sci-fi and fantasy in the 2000s. I hope he makes more that aren't just Top Gun 3 and Days of Thunder 2.
"Are they really that into movies? I ask because if they don’t see James Gunn wrote and directed as being enough to give the movie a shot, they probably aren’t aware of his track record. 


The guy turned fucking Polkadot Man into a sympathetic hero, made an anthropomorphic raccoon one of the most popular characters of the MCU, and created a show about a third rate, meathead, wannabe superhero that’s better than the majority of the D+ junk Marvel has put out.


The guy excels with material most people think is impossible to adapt well to the screen."
Hell I live in Cleveland where the marketing was extra because it was filmed here and superhero fatigue is real. We’re just tired of the concept
"I am a bit puzzled by Superman's reaction. The movie is just ok. Nothing Earth shattering and the box office numbers kind of prove that. They needed something... super to be a box office smash hit and the movie is just ok. It has a lot of heart, not denying that, but the rest is a bit underwhelming"
Exactly why Gunn added Krypto to the story.
Your friends won’t go see a Superman movie that’s not made by anyone that had anything to do with the Superman movies they didn’t like? That’d like not eating a steak made by a chef because ten years ago you ate a steak your buddy made.
He's actually a boring underpowered character that can't be interesting.
Superman is a bad movie.  It’s a poor attempt at making Guardians of the Galaxy 4.  All the characters are a joke.  Superman is a pussy in every fight and overly sexual with Lois which comes across super weird on screen and nothing like his character.  Lex luthor has no powers or anything but can somehow make pocket dimensions and let’s not even get into the absurdity of him calling out video game buttons to control his copied Superman.  I was entertained (I do enjoy all the superhero flicks) but I’d put this installment below every single Henry Cavill Superman movie and another failed attempt by DC.
"Fascinating, I wonder how marketing decides where to spend all the money, they definitely have opinions beyond just spreading it all over it seems."
"too bad the faults completely drowned out the ""unusual direction"""
C'mon man
"Yarr, Jurassic Park was the highest grossing movie of all time when it hit (kept till Titanic I think). JP2 was the highest opening day of all time when it hit. People getting eaten by dinosaurs sells hard."
"When you say “weakest JP”movie” you’d best be talking about only the first 3. All of Jurassic World films have been weak at best, and horrible at worst."
"Yep, my 6PM screening was mostly kids."
And how many superhero movies have come out since the last Jurassic World? 15? I really don't know. We can handle 1 dinosaur movie every 3 or 4 years.
"It came out a week before Superman lol, it hasn’t even been out a month. I wouldn’t say it came out at the start of the summer season when that started in May."
"I dont think Pedro is a draw. I think he just so happens to find his way into a lot of big roles that people were going to end up watching anyways. Whether thats due to his agent or him just being great at auditions. 

That's not to say he can't act, or he isnt good at what he does. Clearly he is as he keeps lands these big franchise roles over and over."

But the MCU crowd probably does watch Last of Us and mandalorian
"It’s still hard to say imo because TLOU is globally massive, but Materialists doesn’t get released in most international markets until mid August and later, and same with Eddington which doesn’t even have a release date for most countries. Curious case about F4 though since it’s a Marvel IP."
But the previous 5 movies were very bad
"F1 is my movie of the year 

Just a fun story from beginning to end"
Does Freakier Friday count as F2?
"Soon, but then they’ll release F5 and we’re back to the start"
Did you think Ant man quantumania was good ?
"I've only read like 30-40 FF comics total but it being comic-accurate was not my impression. I can of course be wrong because there's like 80 years of FF or whatever, but the stuff I read was pretty zany, bright, and weird. This movie was pretty muted, gloomy, and serious"
"Comic accurate in what sense? Besides Sue, those characters are not accurate to most depictions of the Fantastic Four in the comics. Like.. at all. "
“Comic accurate” =/= “satisfying” or “good”
">!Ultraman!< wasn’t the primary antagonist. If Luthor got *deus ex machina*’d (or in this case, *deus ad machina*?) before any sort of climactic confrontation I’d be pretty annoyed."
"yes they are very into movies and like James Gunns work, but their lack of enthusiasm of Superman after the content that's come out has really killed any interest in seeing this movie.

But these are generally people who are like ""Superman sucks as a character.  He's not interesting at all.  He's just infinitely powerful, a total square, and only kryptonite can stop him.  That's lame""...   They dont have the nostalgia for the Christopher Reeve movies and their only real exposure to him has been in really bad Snyderverse films and some fighting games.  That character has a huge uphill battle in 2025."
"I'm very aware of Gunn. Superman is my favorite of the DC cast. This looks to be a fantastic addition to the Superman movies.

I'll be waiting for this to stream. It is a definitely watch movie, make no mistake. I just prefer watching at home than chancing Boston theatre etiquette. Though to be fair, Boston is not needed in that sentence, just theatre etiquette. No close Alamo for me."
"I really liked it, but man, it’s so depressing for about 80% of the film. People talk about light and fun, and ignore the utter pummeling and despair."
I think the bar was just so low for the dc universe and Superman so that’s why it’s getting this amount of praise
Yeah dude.  After Schumacher destroyed the Batman brand we saw a similar thing with Batman begins where it struggled to make 400 mil in spite of arguably being the best Batman movie of all time. But over time that audience built and once dark knight came out you had a billion dollar per movie franchise 
Ngl watching the snyder films after Gunn's Superman made me wanna throw myself off a roof. Good for you that you like them more tho.
It’s objectively better then every single movie Snyder has ever made by a wide margin 
"Sure, I'm not praising the films."
I'm talking about box office. All three JW movies made over a billion dollars.
"Look at that, you’re right. For some reason I thought it came out earlier in June. I didn’t see it until what I thought was like week 4 and that was a couple weeks ago."
There are like 3-4 working actors that would qualify as a draw at this point. The era of being able to sell a movie on its star is more or less dead
Me too. People that hangout on the movie subreddit are not representative of the general public
He was barely in the last season of The Last of Us and the last new episode of The Mandalorian was 2 years ago
MCU Fatigue seems to have hit outside the US a bit more i guess.
"Speaking as someone who sees every one of these in cinema and who agrees they are mostly bad, I don't care. I just want to watch dinosaurs chase people and fight eachother. You can have the worst plot line. It's still awesome. "
"JW Fallen Kingdom was so bad I decided not to watch Dominion, which I heard is even worse. That one broke 1 billion box office worldwide. Never underestimate the power of dinosaurs."
"There's only one real Jurassic Park movie, but the others are still fun enough when you treat them for what they are. Cheesy, big budget, dinosaur action movies don't exactly grow on trees."
"You and every other movie nerd on Reddit(including me) does not equal the majority of people seeing movies, you may have thought the last 5 JPs were bad but clearly a lot of other people did not. I always complain Avatar is not that great, but that’s my opinion and clearly not the same as the majority lol."
"And they all made a ton of money still. Also, none of the original trilogy is bad."
YES. It’s a must on IMAX.
Yea felt like a 90s movie with better cinematography 
Then what counts as F3
didn’t see it
It was perfectly fine and leaves Galactus to be used again later. Y'all just like to whine about everything.
"It wasn't a *deus ex machina*, which usually refers to a resolution that comes out of nowhere. F4 spent several scenes setting up and explaining the plan."
Just not sure how many ways there are to defeat the guy who eats planets and is the size of a skyscraper
"Man that sucks because this movie is the exact thing to prove that notion wrong. In fact, it was one of the biggest critiques I've seen, Supes was too weak lol"
This describes my exact feelings toward Superman but Gunn blew me away with this one. He made me finally start to get it
Fair enough. I guess a lot of people tend to put more value in the subject over the creative side. I’m usually the other way around.
Do your friends feel the same way about Captain Marvel? I find that she's just as overpowered and all her fights don't really have any stakes to them.
"I get that. This was actually the first movie I’ve seen in theaters since 2019. You can get a perfectly good, often superior, experience at home and since Covid you don’t even have to wait that long. 


I just felt like I had to vote with my wallet for this one. The extremely outdated metric of box-office take still holds a lot of weight.


Of course, I waited until a weekday afternoon to minimize the bad etiquette you mentioned."
"Of course, but still you needed a home run of a movie to make people come to the movie theater. The reception has been tepid and you can't hide behind ""well, the bar was low. This is not bad"". Same situation with Fantastic 4"
"That’s cause even if they are bad movies too Synder’s characters felt more like believable and truer to their identities.  Gunn made the same mistake as Taika Waititi did with Thor L&T and leaned TOO much into the humor aspect.  This didn’t even feel like a Superman movie, it has a tone more like Guardians of the Galaxy, and that’s not who Superman is."
"Subjectively better. If it’s objectively, what is the criteria you’re using?"
Those were bad movies too.  I would rate them above this but not gonna argue if you think Gunn’s is better.  The dog was the highlight of this whole movie.
"Ah, understood. They made a lot of money, but were kind of terrible movies."
"And Pedro is not one of them. Even the people who make the most money in Hollywood like the Rock, aren't turning a profit with every Movie they release.

I think its pretty definitive that Movie Stars are dead. BUT, I also think that Movie Directors are bigger than ever. Whether it's James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Denis Villenueve, Jordan Peele, etc. 

I'd say Directors are the draw more than anything else at this point."
I don’t think people will go to a movie just for an actor I agree. But I am more likely to go see a film instead of waiting for streaming if I like the actor/cast.
This is why we can't have a good dinosaur movie this :( 
"Is that the one with the balls?


That's the last one I saw lol"
"Jaws was the same.

Fantastic genre reinventing film followed by diminishing returns."
I said it was fine?
"I was moreso going for the “god in the machine” joke. Anyway, my point is that there was zero resolution to the Galactus conflict. He was there, and then he wasn’t. Felt rushed."
"Maaaan they fucked up the “planet eating” thing too. People in this thread are praising how comic-accurate F4 is but they change Galactus so that >!his *ship* eats the planets and feeds him via the tubes on his back?!< 

As a lifelong comics reader I wanted to see him take a chomp out of Mars or something. Nope, they were afraid of that looking silly so they gave him an IV drip."
"And the “he’s too weak” is a bogus take from people who only watched the trailers. It’s not that Supes is weak, it’s that we finally have a comic book accurate Lex who is a scientific genius and master at exploiting Superman’s weaknesses. One of which, ironically, is his humanity."
"Is she though, they kinda boned her character with the movies. Even thanos puts up a good fight against her. She doesn't seem very powerful in the films in context to other characters even though she is meant to be the strongest. In the movies I feel like Thor is the strongest character of MCU by far. They even dumb him down to fight thanos in End Game."
Fair shout on voting with wallet. I'll have to find a matinee somewhere.
"Word of mouth has been really good and its box office holds have spoken to that. Reception hasn’t been tepid, it’s been cautious. But like Batman Begins, it’ll build up over time and during its home release."
" Not sure Superman going ""Noone stays good forever"" after being Superman for 20 mins is ""truer"" to their identities lmao"
Established criteria for measuring the quality of film by which Superman is objectively better than every movie Zack Snyder and his classmate Michael bay have ever made 
"In the last 5 years, those directors have made a combined 6 movies. You're not wrong that those directors can be box office draws but there's usually only 1-2 of those per year"
I dont think movie stars are dead they just aren't killing it these days like brad pitt or damon or tom cruisein the 90's early 00's.
I think they do for Tom Cruise...he is a one man band
"I'm sorry. One day man, one day 🥲"
You literally just insinuated what they did wasn't good or satisfying.
"Almost every single appearance I can think of (which is a lot) he's a few hundred feet tall and uses machines to process planets into energy that he consumes. Almost all the art of him actually eating planets is fan art or from materials outside the comics themselves, and I've only been able to find one panel with him actually eating plants (Fantastic Four: Antithesis #2). I'm not sure you're as big a fan as you think you are."
Yeah I mean that would’ve been interesting lol. Ultimately I think it’s a size dilemma. If he’s legitimately big enough to eat a planet then it’s not really possible for humans to fight him lol.
"Probably best movie adaptation of Lex to date, finally Lex can go toe to toe with Superman instead of being a damsel in distress for Superman’s “moral dilemma”"
"He spent the entire movie having his butt beaten into the ground. Even before any kryptonite or faux-kryptonite was introduced. 

He has humanity, he isn't human."
"How do you measure word of mouth?. I wouldn't say it has held up. Regular drops in box office... and the foreign box office is a disaster. It's 500 million in and it's a steep incline to the 600 mark. Home release? How does that matter. It doesn't generate money. It's free to click ""play"" on HBO Max, why would that speak good about the movie? (Free as in it doesn't cost you extra from your monthly description). What I mean is that everyone was propping this movie up and all I hear now is excuses ""well, it's doing Batman Begins numbers because people didn't trust the brand anymore"" ""well, if it goes over MOS domestic box office that is a huge win"" ""well there is heat wave in Europe"". We know it has to go over 600 million to break even. It is very clear it won't top MOS worldwide box office of 670 million. What am I missing? For the record, I wasn't a fan of MOS either"
"I totally forgot about how the whole city of Metropolis gets ripped apart in this movie and yet no one got hurt, we're only led to care when the rift is reaching a small park with a few people.  The city feels lifeless.  Just awful all around."
Both Man of Steel and Superman Returns are superior films to this new installment.  Batman vs Superman and Justice league iterations are downright bad and I would put Gunn's superman with those.  Everything about it is off.
"Okay. So you don’t understand the difference between objective and subjective.

Just say that next time."
I think that’s probably a big component of their draw is that they don’t release a lot. Most people don’t go to a lot of movies so 1-2 a year is perfect for them plus the low risk of going to a movie of a known director
"I said the ending was bad, but the first sentence in my first comment was “F4 was fine.”

Thunderbolts and Superman just set the bar higher, so a perfectly *fine* 7/10 movie like F4 feels disappointing.

It’s okay for movies to just be mid."
Lmao I love how MCU Fans get all gatekeepy and accuse you of not being a fan when you dare question the Almighty Kevin’s choices
"[The Galactus I wanted](https://i.redd.it/hu8kmtm022wd1.png)

[The Galactus we got](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f6cf1a893e35255d4d7e89d/1627344568162-FQT5D8RBZD8KFLCJFKJ6/staypuft.jpg)"
"So? Not once in the movie is he beaten because he’s “weak”. It’s done by Lex exploiting established vulnerabilities using his insane scientific resources, tactical genius and complete lack of morals when it comes to accomplishing his goals. Not at all out of the ordinary in the comics.


And his humanity is his desire to help others and do good. Lex exploits this repeatedly throughout the movie. With the people of Jarhanpur, Krypto, and an average citizen of Metropolis."
"Cinema score paired with week to week holds. It’s drops are above average for a comic book movie. Even its legs overseas are performing better than expected. 

Physical media is a big revenue stream for movies still. It’s not talked about but it’s a very lucrative avenue still. Wicked made $100 million on PVOD alone. And as far as how it would be good, it’s simple: when it’s viewed as “free” to watch, people who did not see it in theaters will be more likely to watch it and by building that trust with weary audience members, it makes a sequel more likely to do better. This is exactly what happened with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.

These aren’t excuses, it’s the reality of our current media landscape. There also wasn’t a “propping up” of Superman. It’s performing better than expected week to week. It also doesn’t need to do 600m to break even. Its break even is $550m."
Taste is subjective.  Quality is objective.   Snyder has never made a movie over 59/100 on metacritic and his movies have been consistently panned for similar fundamental reasons.   He’s an objectively bad filmmaker who some people subjectively enjoy 
"For  anyone who's actually interested in learning more about Galactus in the comics, here's a [gallery](https://imgur.com/a/HCgvvvp) of just a few examples from over the years, going all the way back to the first appearance arc and all the way to modern stuff. 

Galactus can be big enough to eat a planet like a cookie, but very rarely has been shown doing so. He's a cosmic abstract entity, the Devourer, a role in the Marvel cosmology that serves to help maintain the cosmic balance, and one that persists across the various incarnations of the Marvel multiverse (called Firmaments). 

Despite being able to appear however he wants, Galactus has been remarkably consistent across the years, typically ranging from a few dozen feet up to about 500-1000 on the high end. He uses a massive ship to process planets into food, but doesn't need it to do so, instead using it to purify and expedite the process. Why does he do this if he can also just become enormous and eat planets? Because comic book writers want him to, and they want him to do it that way 99.9% of the time. 

If you want a Watsonian explanation for it, just say it's incredibly inefficient for him to do so. Some writers have probably said as much at some point, but I can't be bothered to check."
Yeah lol. You should check out arishem form Eternals
">Physical media is a big revenue stream for movies still.

Oh dude. That revenue stream is almost dead. Wanna buy a 4K disk on Target or Best Buy?

>Even its legs overseas are performing better than expected. 

You mean the disaatrous international showing? Those are some elgs right there. I mean, it's not a box office bomb, I'll give you that, but it's not performing well, it's just ok. We'll see if it can cross 600... or 550 million for that matter."
"Again, your grasp on objective vs subjective is the issue here, not your OPINION on Snyder. 

You can say “Snyder makes longer films than Gunn.” That’s something we can objectively measure. His ranking on metacritic is also measurable. 

But how you FEEL about those films is subjective, and declaring him a “bad filmmaker” is also subjective.

You can have any opinion you choose, just stop labeling an opinion as objective fact."
"It’s really not. Sales have shifted to online retailers but it’s still a multi-million dollar revenue stream. Acting like it isn’t is just wrong. 

Its international holds are as good as its domestic holds so the proof is in the numbers. You just have to be capable of reading them against the standards for comic book movies.

550 is a lock, it’s already at 500 and it’s daily gross is in the 5-9 million range. That’s just domestic and that’s not taking into consideration its weekend gross which if you stick with a 50 percent range drop is still about 10-13 million."
"You can prefer your nephew’s finger painting over the Mona Lisa. That’s subjective.  But the qualities by which we measure art, one is objectively better.  And that remains true of Superman being objectively better than everything Zack Snyder has ever made in his life even if you have shit taste in art and happen to like Snyderverse slop. "
I think the only proper way to watch any film is a Jerry rigged Gameboy color
ONYX SCREEN?
Brother. There are so many better ways to spend your evening.
I plan on watching a cam on my favorite bootleg site.
Watch it twice. One in Onyx and one in Imax.
"Go with IMAX, they shot the whole movie (I believe) using IMAX cameras."
i am watching in onyx
micro led cunema Experience. Basically like have an OLED screen in cinema. But hrighter and better cintrast than even OLEDs
It will still look better on OnYx
cool! I may watch it in ONYX for my second rewatch. I'm going to watch it first on Imax so I can't wait to compare both screens
Onyx is like watching OLED tv in the cinema. Imax has gne film look you accustom to Nostalgia. Imax screens with projectors will soon be phased out and become redundant.

"Obligatory comment to spread the Gospel of McQ. Any and every film fan needs to hunt down this guy’s interviews and podcast appearances. Cannot think of another filmmaker as generous as he is with his failures and his process. 

Sucks about the strikes, but it’s such good news that MI8 got delayed by a year and gets its own big prime summer holiday weekend release with IMAX for a few weeks.

It’s a shame Barbenheimer took the wind out of MI7s sails because Dead Reckoning was awesome; not quite the highs of Fallout but that is to be expected for a 2 parter that still has lots of questions to answer."

If PTA is adapting Gravity's Rainbow or Mason and Dixon I'll be able to die happy.
Possibly Noah Baumbach's next project on Netflix with Adam Sandler and George Clooney? They concluded filming earlier this year.
"When I saw David Michod was making Wizard I was excited because I thought it was remake of Ralph Bakshi’s fantasy classic from the 70s.

Sadly it’s not, it’s a movie about stoners finding money from a bank heist. "

The Phoenician Scheme is such a Wes Anderson title.
Maybe not considered major enough to make the list but I’m personally most hyped Robert Eggers - Nosferatu
Can they stop doing Jurassic Park movies already?
I am terribly upset that The Phoenician Scheme is not a Fulgrim origin story.
Rumor is the new PTA is called The Battle of Baktan Cross and the new Coogler is called Sinners

Del Toro doing Frankenstein?? That's awesome 
Friend lent me Mickey 7 the other week and said I had to read it. One of the worst books I’ve ever read. Felt like a high school creative writing project. The concept is a thinly veiled rip off of the movie MOON. Hopefully Ho can find something in that surface deep book.
Nosferatru by Eggers is coming out next year (early) is it not?
Wes Anderson just cranks em out.
Good luck Oscars…phew
Some really interesting concepts here I didn’t know about — really interested in the Anne Hathaway / Ewan McGregor dinosaurs in the 80s movie. Wtf
"Danny Boyle - 28 Years Late

Lowkey the thing that matters on this list"
Lol Jurassic Park 7. Fuck me
I can't wait for 28 years later!
I wish the Coen's were back together
"Gareth Edwards is doing Jurassic Park?!

🤔 most intriguing.

Edit: lol reading through the history they changed directors relatively recently, and aren’t even projected to finish filming til October."
Good to see Danny Boyle and Alex Garland back at the directing and writing helms of the 28...Later franchise. I think the sequel without them missed the mark a bit from the amazing original that they helmed. Also having 28 Days Later's Cillian Murphy back for the 3rd movie (with the always great Ralph Fiennes) is going to be epic!
I'm going to get A-List again. My family can deal without me three nights a week.
That Danny Boyle movie better be a sequel to 28 Days Later and not some sort of romantic comedy.
Havoc was shot 17 years ago. About time it gets a release
"Nothing from Nolan, Tarantino, Scorsese? :("
"Wait, there's going to be another Pynchon adaptation?

The last one wasn't exactly a great adaptation of the book, but was entertaining enough in its own right so whatever I'll take another. I wonder what book it's going to be? Low key hoping for a 4 hour adaptation of Mason & Dixon."
Jurassik Park 7. Are we so far now? Lmao.
Nearly 40 movies.  Drafthouse is going to make bank off me next year.
Fuqua remaking Michael? Omg I'm so in!
Really looking forward to Havoc. I just hope this is Gareth Evan's big stake in American/European Industry. Apostle was ok and Gangs of London was good. I just think he needs that one big break here. I can't believe its 10 yrs since Raid 2 already.
"Pumped about Caught Stealing by Aronovsky, the book trilogy is excellent"
Whatever happened to Gus Van Sant?  I remember thinking he was one of the best most thoughtful directors around but he kind of fell off the map.
JP is next year already?
Is Danny Boyle directing 28 years or just producing. I thought it was Candymans Nia Dacosta
"Oh fuck yeah, another Gareth Evans picture.  The Raid films are insane and Gangs of London for the scenes he directed was incredible."
James Mangold?
When Paul Thomas Anderson has a film in the works... I pay attention. Might be starring Leonardo DeCaprio?
Most excited for Guillermo Del Toro’s Frankenstein
We eating good next year
Most excited for Superman and Avatar 3 I have to say.
"Isn't Jordan Peele's next film set for 2025? I felt ""NOPE"" was not just his best film yet, but my favorite film of 2022 and a movie I couldn't get out of my head for weeks(Best alien film since Signs)

Saw Hereditary, Midsommer, and Beau is Afraid in theaters; so I'm super excited for a new Ari Aster. I read a review of the leaked script for ""Eddington"". Big fan of small town movies, though not sure how a movie soaked in the hot button socio-political climate of 2020 is going to work. Im sure itll still have weird surrealist moments even if its very political.

Bummed the Safdie Bros are going their separate ways, I just wonder which brother's films will carry that signature Good Time/Uncut Gems cinematography/weird soundtrack/nervous vibe. I just read Josh Safdie's film with Adam Sandler has been put on hold.

A new Terrence Malick film? Surprised his next film isn't made for The Sphere in Las Vegas.

At this point, Wes Anderson is full on self parody. An AI text to video program with ChatGPT could make a spot on Wes Anderson film. That said I'll see anything of his in theaters, and absolutely was mesmerized by Asteroid City on a big screen."
I think Josh Safdie’s Marty Supreme is due out next year since it’s shooting this year
Lol oh god another Jurassic Park? Are we going back to San Diego like in the third one 🤔 🤣🤣
Thanks for this.
Knives Out 3 is called Wake Up Dead Man
David Robert Mitchell also has They Follow coming out next year
How many of these don't have release dates? I do a movie auction every January and if you win a movie that doesn't come out you're fucked

"**2025 is shaping up to be an incredible year for film!** With so many acclaimed directors releasing new projects, there's something for everyone to look forward to. I'm particularly excited about Bong Joon Ho's *Mickey 17*, Park Chan Wook's *I Can't Help It*, and Wes Anderson's *The Phoenician Scheme*. What are you most anticipating?"
"Sad to see no Christopher Nolan, Steven Spielberg, M. Night Shyamalan, Todd Phillips, or David Fincher"
Here to hoping Knives Out 3 is great… KO 2 was easily the worst movie I’ve seen since Wonder Woman 2. Am looking forward to Mickey 17 and PTA new film
"Lol, Gareth Evans as major director... :D"
"I was hoping we'd get an Adam McKay movie next year but it looks like his existing projects have been kinda scrapped and he's doing something else now. 

Hope we get something from him soon, Don't Look Up is 3 years ago now... Wild."
Superman is my most anticipated movie. Hope James Gunn cooks
High and Low is going to be STUNNING
"""Major"""
"Yikes

Nothing that I’m overtly excited for and maybe 3 I’ll end up watching and enjoy"
"Remove James Gunn from this list, he doesn't fit the bill."
i only didnt list in since it already premiered at Cannes and could still release by the end of this year.
"Forgot there was a trailer for that! I was surprised how after years since ExistenZ, he finally went full on bizarro body horror with Crimes of the Future.  Still can't get over how bugnuts weird that was, as a fan of weird 80s/90s horror. I absolutely loved Brandon Croenberg's Possessor, so to have pops back to making insane wtf movies is truly amazing."
I saw Presence at Sundance this past year. Wild how long movies take to be distributed. Excellent film that could have been completely mishandled by a lesser director
Remember when he “retired”?
Has 2 so far…* lol
Years with 2 Soderbergh movies tend to be pretty lit.
Will watch literally anything he touches
For a second I thought you said Todd Haynes was directing a STAR TREK movie and my mind went a thousand different directions.
">S. Craig Zahler- The Bookie & The Bruiser

And sold. I'll be there opening night. I don't even need to know the story."
">Dan Trachtenberg - Badlands

My dumbass immediately thinks ""Why would you do a Terrence Malick remake?!"""
"Wow shane black needs a Win badly, he almost single handedly killed the Predator franchise"
"I'm excited for The Accountant 2, the first one was so good! And Gavin O' Connor's Warrior (2011) is my favorite movie."
"When Predator Badlands was first announced, I assumed it was going to be set in the American wild west of the latter 1800s, continuing the Prey continuity. Reading it's set in some futuristic desert wasteland made me less excited, as we've see the Mad Max desert setting a lot(tho a Predator film has never been set in the future, so it could have potential) 

Civil War is my favorite film of 2024(Loved Ex Machina and Annihilation) so any new Alex Garland film is a must watch."
also Herzog's Bucking Fastard's maybe
Will I understand it if I haven't seen Juror No. 1?
yeah havoc had a long journey.  Based on Evans' comments of the reshoots it is guaranteed now for a 2025 release.  Likely first half of the year and maybe it even goes to a film festival
I give Clint credit.   He could have retired decades ago and he would have had an amazing career.   He obviously loves what he does.   Hope he directs a movie at 100.
Mid 90s people can be sharp as a tack still. Watch James Hong’s speech at the SAGs
"working title, although maybe it will stick."
Dino movie eh
Can’t find many details on it online. What is it about relating to dinosaurs?
Just do the god damned Django x Zorro movie already…
"The whole 10 movie thing is dumb as fuck. Just keep making movies if you want to. Don't make up bullshit rules. Imagine Martin Scorcese or Clint Eastwood or Ridley Scott has drawn an arbitrary line. All the gems of their later years we'd have missed.


If he genuinely hates the process so much he can't go past 10, I respect that."
Heard him on a podcast he’s doing tv (miniseries)
Gimmie dat  Star Trek movie!!  He can keep his 10 movie limit intact by working on non QT original IP’s I would hope.
"He's been falling off hard ever since he lost his editor. I loved Django and IB, but everything after has had some pretty glaring issues with pacing and length. Once upon a time..  was an overly long meandering mess of a movie that desperately needed to be cut down. H8 was just a mediocre story that was also overly long and needed editing."
"Honestly, the plot doesn't even look interesting. if Tarantino wasn't attached most people probably wouldn't even see it"
Am I the only one that’s really enjoyed this year?
OOOH WHA HE DOIN?
"Mickey 7 was a really good book, I'm looking forward to the film adaptation."
I really hope it's good. My soul needs a good Superman movie so badly.
"July 2025 is gonna be crucial for superhero films if both Superman & Fantastic Four do well, I hope for this"
"Didn’t love the book Mickey 7-  but I trust that bong can do something cool with it. It’s a great idea, was just a lackluster execution in the novel"
"Words cannot express how much I don't want to see a David Ayer movie to begin with, but putting Old Man Statham and Scientologist Michael Peña in there, that really seals the deal.

The plot of the film with Chazelle also doesn't sound promising.

*""The story follows a former Navy SEAL and his retired combat dog who attempt to return to civilization after a catastrophic accident deep in the Alaskan wilderness.""*

I feel like this pitch has been made about a half dozen times, and names like Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson, and Sam Jackson all immediately come to mind."
Ayer and Statham is literally perfect combo for me. I loved Beekeeper so much.
I dont think it's either. The current speculation is that it's Vineland considering PTA was shooting his new movie around Monterey and Watsonville in California earlier this year.
Malick is unpredictable but so far there's nothing to suggest it won't release any time in 2025.  This seems to be his biggest ever gap from actual filming to release (shot in 2019.....) and even the actors have said the release is set for then
it is absolutely major.  Just it is releasing in December 2024.
"Honestly, no. Big budget dinosaurs forever!!"
The upcoming PTA release is rumored to be the Vineland adaptation.
And Maggie Gyllenhaal doing a Bride of Frankenstein as well...
It has a Christmas Day release date. 
"In the weird fucked up miserable reality we live, I'm very happy that he does. I need his beautiful storybook worlds to escape to. Asteroid City was such a gem."
They are working on something together actually. 
"Nolan and Scorsese both did high-quality movies last year.

Good movies take time."
His new film comes out late this year. 
It definitely stars DiCaprio. There are pics of him on set. 
I think Ari aster is super creative and interesting . I watched beau is afraid really late and I was so sleepy and I felt high . It was ja unforgettable experience
You’re gonna get one because the new Knives Out movie is almost ready…
Nolan's not that fast and Oppenheimer was last year. I think it'll be 2026 at the earliest before we get something new from him.
[removed]
"Phillips has a movie at the end of this year so not surprising.   
M Night? Really? That man has made nothing but trash for years now lol"
"He's a major director in the action genre, which is a pretty major genre."
"The Raid 1+2 are essential action movies, especially of last 20 years.  Definitely belongs on the list"
"Yeah, he was going to do a movie with Robert Pattinson as a serial killer, but ended up canning it before the strikes. 

Last we heard, he's doing a Climate Change project, but no real updates"
Is that a remake of the Kurosawa?
"i listed him because of the few franchises i decided to cover here, hes a director who has a notable reputation from his marvel/dc work.  I suppose he has a certain style, especially carrying from his days with Troma."
"You guessed it, ladies and gentlemen: this person posts on r/SnyderCut."
You might not like his work but there's very few directors on that list who's films have had as high a box office gross as some of Gunns. He obviously fits the bill of successful directors.
Could someone please kindly help this lost cult member find his way back to whatever cesspool he usually wallows in?
"Weird take, he's made multiple highly successful and critically acclaimed movies."
"Homie has made nearly 3 Billion in box office as a director, and if you include his credits as just a screenwriter or the executive producer, he’s about to hit the 8 Billion dollar mark. 

He’s got cult hits, massive franchise hits, and was handed the reins to the entire DC Universe. 

I don’t love everything he’s made, but saying he isn’t a major name in the game right now is just silly"
lol notice how Snyder isn’t on the list 😭
Bro wanted to put Rebel Moon : Ultra Cut by Zack Snyder lmfao. The usual culprits
We would've heard something yet if it was releasing this year and it still doesn't even have US distribution. It'll absolutely be a 2025 release
I have tickets for this at TIFF! What did you think of the movie (no spoilers pls)?
"I think Netflix bought I Don’t Feel At Home in this World Anymore and dropped it with advertising before the fest ended. A year+ is not the norm, I’d say most Sundance sales, even with theatrical releases can be out by Summer, but are often held back for fall awards. 

Something a year+ probably means the distributor doesn’t think it is a good fit for summer blockbuster season, or fall awards, so they are holding it for slower winter months the following year. They could get it out sooner if they wanted."
"Yup. And then he came back to continue working at the same breakneck pace he had before he ""retired."" He's like the bus that couldn't slow down."
especially if one is a mainstream banger & the other one is a more auteur-driven piece
But isnt that what it says?
Me too. Stars Vince Vaughn and Adrien Brody.
Technically david lynch and tony scott+Quentin tarantino did their own spins of Badlands already
"It's crazy too, cause he did The Nice Guys before that, which ruled... but The Predator really hurt his reputation"
"2018 ""The Predator"" is so terrible, almost makes AVP Requiem feel like an A24 film. Shane Black's The Predator had the look/low budget feel of those old cheapo SyFy or Asylum mockbuster movies."
I based my thesis is college around his work. It's interesting to see how far he goes.
Kill Bill 3
Or if he pairs with Edgar Wright for a full-length Don't adaptation
"Part of me respects it, and he's kind of a weirdo anyway so it makes sense he would do this. But of course I'm selfish and want more. I'm not sure if he's ever indicated he doesn't like the process?"
"He's explained it a few times on podcasts why he's doing 10. And it's not so much that he hates it, it's just that he feels like he's getting too old and he has a kid/family now and that's where his focus is. Plus he lives between the states and Israel half the year. So that's a lot to juggle."
"Tbf it’s also not rly a handicap, he’s already talked about potentially doing a series too. So he could very well do his 10 movie cap and then spend years working on a show for HBO or something"
"Feels to me like it's just wankery he says to seem more ""special"""
Yeah I was really bummed to hear that he scrapped the movie critic idea where Brad Pitt was coming back as his character from Once Upon a Time. The 10 movie thing might have robbed us on that idea since Quentin has to prioritize only one more
"Agree 100%. I mean, he's literally already directed 10 theatrical films(counting Death Proof, since it arrived on home market as a stand alone, and counting Kill Bill and Kill Bill Vol 2 as 2 separate films) There's a really good newerish documentary on his films called ""QT8: The First 8"" on Tubi that plays into the mythos of his ""10"" movies(trailer here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntEEWFam\_Xg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntEEWFam_Xg) )   That said, we've seen Ridley Scott, Scorcesse, Copolla, Michael Mann, and so many master directors make a number of stinkers. And I can't think of any of QT's work being a disappointment. He also has surprisingly taken more time between films than I realized."
He's apparently been writing one to make at some point
"I think it's a pipe dream at this point, but boy I'd love to see whatever the hell that was going to be.."
To each their own I guess
I loved that Once Upon a Time was meandering. It's one of my favourite films.
He did Django Unchained after losing Sally Menke
"Hard agree, I would go so far as to say I disliked Hateful 8."
It’s not been announced yet has it?
"Nope, I think this year has been pretty good! Just next 2 years appear to be a tad stronger. 

Dune 2, Kingdom of the Planet of The Apes, Inside Out 2, Hitman, Hundreds of Beavers, Last Stop in Yuma County, Longlegs, Civil War, Bad Boys 4, The Fall Guy, Twisters, Monkey Man, The First Omen, Kneecap, A Quiet Place, Challengers, Alien, Deadpool 3, Furiosa, Abigial, Beverly Hill Cop IV, Shirley, Maxxxine. 

All liked critically/by audiences, and pretty solid-great imo"
"The releases that came out were good but Summer was pretty dry. A few years back, me and my friends went to the theater almost every week."
Yeah sure. You’re the only one.
My Adventures With Superman is so good it just has me itching at the possibility we get a good adaptation for the silver screen
"The first released image being a giant energy battle in the sky has me already checked out. Good luck, hope it's good too."
Plus Vineland is actually filmable. I love me some Gravity’s Rainbow but there’s no way a movie-length narrative could do any justice to that.
"It's also a 100 Million dollar movie billed as an event film. Seems really strange for Vineland, but who the hell knows."
"Ahh, my bad. Thought it was next year"
"oh my eyes skipped right pas it, thanks"
"Ah, I see, I'm from UK so when I searched it went by the UK release."
I'll take that
"Had not heard that, I’m very intrigued!!"
That's your opinion. Everything since After Earth has been good and generally well received by critics and audiences.
"That was 10 and 10+ years ago. Made 1 movie and 5 episodes since. The movie not even worth mentioning. He's everything, but a major director..."
Yup
"If his Marvel work is so outstanding and important, then you should list the directors coming out with Fantastic Four: First Steps, Thunderbolts*, and Captain America: Brave New World. I mean they are basically unknowns, but it's still Marvel, right?"
"I have no idea what kind of reach you must have to be able to pull those numbers out of your a**hole. His Guardians trilogy for Marvel were his only successful movies, and they were only a moderate success at the box office. None of them passed a billion, which even Deadpool & Wolverine and Captain Marvel did."
"I definitely think it’ll hit in 2025, however, we thought the exact same thing about “A Complete Unknown” just a month ago so there is some merit to the assumption"
"I thought it was fantastic. Extremely engaging, and the hook is followed through to a very satisfying conclusion rather than just being a gimmick."
Todd / Toby
"I justdont understand what went wrong, when i heard he was making the movie then i thought it was gonna be a slam dunk"
He’s suggested that if he does ever make Kill Bill Vol. 3 it “won’t count” because he’s just making more of an already existing movie.
Pulp Fiction 2
"I refute this purely because I hate the notion of the films already being two parts, I’ve always called it one film. Having another film called part 3 would just legitimise then all being separate films for me 😂"
"He seems to love it, which is what puzzles me."
Fair enough.
It's a handicap if it stops him doing what he is best at. I don't know if he wants to finish out his career with TV execs breathing down his neck.
Agreed and can almost guarantee he'll do another film at some point.
I'd personally kill for an original QT sci-fi movie
It's become a comfort movie for me. If I don't know what to watch I'll just throw it on. It's probably one of my favourites now
It's all style no substance. And I love the style.
"Yeah, and? It's been a progressive decline ever since. I'm sure her way of doing things suck with him initially, but he's completely lost sight of it as time has passed."
"Probably my most disappointing movie experience. I went to a 70mm showing of it complete with intermission on opening night.  I left so incredibly disappointed in what I saw after being so incredibly excited for it prior to release. It has some redeeming qualities, sure, but overall just a huge disappointment."
"Well it was gonna be The Movie Critic but idk now after reading this

https://www.vulture.com/article/quentin-tarantino-final-film-movie-critic-everything-we-know.html"
Sing Sing and The Bikeriders were pretty good as well. I can't wait to see Kneecap.
"Furiosa was my favorite, and there’s still more cool stuff to come. We aren’t even in Oscar season yet"
"Longlegs to me is film of the year, just in terms of audacious weirdness and cinematography. I liked Dune 2 more than part 1, and Civil War was absolutely amazing to see on a big screen in terms of tone/sound design/cinematography. On second thought, Civil War is my favorite 2024 movie so far. Alien Romulus looked gorgeous on a big screen as well, and despite hating the trailers, I felt Furiosa delivered and felt worthy of the praise Fury Road got. Last Stop In Yuma County is in this weird emerging streaming era comedy heist thriller sub-genre I call ""shit goes sideways fast in a small town"", which I'd include Maggie Moores, One Day A Lion, Vengeance or the upcoming Greedy People."
Kneecap was so fucking good
Also loved Abigail
[deleted]
"Agreed. Aside from the designs, I adore that show. "
I loved the first two. I really don’t understand the hate for Glass Onion. I thought it broke down the murder mystery formula even more completely than Knives Out. I’m unironically waiting for the next one with bated breath.
"Agree, I enjoyed Old and Split. I’ve not seen Trap yet"
Agreed
"none of those movies have directors who have fully established careers yet.  Gunn is one of the few directors who has really made a name for themself from their marvel work.  Even his work prior, Super and Slither

I only listed a few franchise movies here and I put down Gunn's name because hes one of the more notable names working exclusively in franchise world"
"Title literally says major director, not major movie."
"But he isn't unknown, that's why he's there."
"Box office numbers can be googled, and math isn’t that difficult. 

This site aggregates them conveniently - https://www.the-numbers.com/person/59460401-James-Gunn#tab=technical

The 3 Guardians movies alone made about 2.5 Billion in box office, and you can reference the general accuracy of those numbers by comparing reports from multiple sources - Google provides many"
Moderate successes??? 90% of Hollywood would kill to have the box office returns of the guardians movies lol. 700 million for Z listers debuting and closing in at 850 million for the third movie is a box office golden goose.
That gives him flexibility to say volume 2 doesn't count.  And arguably Death Proof is only half a movie.
"Wait so by that logic, does that mean that Vol. 2 doesn't count? Is there a chance for us to get two more Tarantino movies?!"
[deleted]
"Well he did had a plan to do a spinnoff featuring the Vega brothers so it would’ve been a prequel to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but sadly it never came through :("
It would just be the third volume of the same movie.
"I suspect he wants every movie he makes to ""count"", instead of just getting into the habit of making movies as a routine."
"Not rly, creatives can get complacent, if you don’t think your doing your best work in your existing situation you have to impose rules on yourself to force creativity. I imagine that’s largely what this is for him."
"And pull out some ""It's not a film, it's a visual narrative by way of picture succession"" bs to justify it."
"I’m on the fence with it. The idea and setting is one of my favorites, but the execution felt off to me. Maybe it is the pacing.

I love the actors, I know the script was written with many of them in mind, but part of me feels like it would really hit harder with folks that weren’t Tarantino regulars. Some character actors off the top of my head I think would kill it- Sam Rockwell, Ted Levine, Scoot McNairy, Ben Foster, Barry Pepper, basically character actors that can swing big, but wouldn’t ham it up. Somebody like the late Michael K Williams in the Jackson’s part. I could be wrong. It is a great cast."
I was sure he shitcanned that idea a while ago. Perhaps he changed his mind again!
"I thought I missed something, thanks for reminding me lol!"
yeah the costume and robot designs are crazy bad
"Same . I got my wife into these and the hercule poirot movies (murder on the orient Express , death on the Nile, haunting in Venice)  and now she's fiending for more"
Why do people like Old it was so narratively jarring
Making three moderately successful Marvel movies doesn't make him a major director. It's like going on the comic con stage saying RDJ is the best actor in the world because he played Iron Man.
I was replying to OP.
"Outside of Marvel? No, he's basically completely unknown."
"I think Vol 2 already doesn’t count. Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood makes nine movies. His next movie will be his tenth, unless it’s Kill Bill Vol. 3 in which case it’s just more of his fourth."
R rated Star Trek
"Well no it would be years later, this would be the sequel. Ideally a new film would be kill bill 2 😂"
Yea but declaring that line in the sand long before you get there seems like a really silly way to ensure such a thing.
"My problems weren't with the acting,I actually thought they all did great. I think the story was just sub par and I think the WAY it was told was dumb. Tarantino's voiceover started the free fall for the movie"
Ha no worries
">It's like going on the comic con stage saying RDJ is the best actor in the world because he played Iron Man.

No one is saying Gunn is the best director in the world. But I do agree, he's one of the weaker directors of those on the list."
Lol so you also don't understand reddit? Anyone can respond for future reference.
"Slither, Super, The Suicide Squad, and Peacemaker are all awesome. 

You can hate James Gunn, Marvel, whatever. But calling him unknown is disingenuous."
"No, OP is calling him a major director, which is objectively wrong."
"Those three movies were all massive box office bombs. They failed hard, look them up. You might like them, but noone went to see them. Also, that actually speaks against your point of trying to make him out to be some kind of major successful director with a golden touch. He definitely does not belong on this list."
"I agree, but saying he's a major director is not like saying ""RDJ is the best actor in the world because he played Iron Man"""
He has more box office successes than 75% of this list lol. If that's your criteria then we better remove people like Benny Safdie.
Dennis Villeneuve is mostly box office bombs too but I don’t think that makes him a mediocre director
I’m just going to say I strongly disagree. But I’m glad I’m in the minority.
Feel like I’m taking crazy pills because I cancelled amc a list because this year has been extremely average to me. Wait to see how the year finishes to be sure.
I’m not feeling this year at all tbh
Companion
K Pop Demon Hunters
"So far it’s not as strong as 2023 (best year of 2020s) but it definitely has the potential to be. Excited for F4, Together, weapons, wicked, avatar, one battle after another, etc."
"I disagree. First half of this year at least to me has been weaker compared to 2024. So far Sinners and Black Bag were the only overall great movies I’ve seen this year  compared to this time last year where Dune: Part Two, Civil War and Furiosa were already on my great list. 

Second half of 2025 seems stacked though so I’m hoping I’ll feel differently by the end of December."
Man Im sorry.  Dont get me wrong Superman was a fun little romp but ihavent seen anything over a 7 this year.
"I would have said everything this year is shit, until I watched Bring Her Back. What an incredibly well acted, well written, well filmed, well paced horror film."
"I got a monthly pass at my local cinema chain, and so far I've felt like I got my money's worth. It definitely helps that having it makes you more tolerant of not-so-good films."
"Superman, 28 Years Later, and Sinners were the standouts for me so far. I think what I liked most was that they felt fresh, even when they were sequels or reboots. So many of the films this year have been a breath of fresh air. 

I honestly share the sentiment about it being a great movie year. Not necessarily because the movies are so great, but because they are leaving me feeling more hopeful about the state cinema."
Nobodies mentioned warfare.
No it hasn't. It just has been less of a dumpster fire than 2024.
"This year has been very horror movie heavy, which my family hates, but I’ve been eating it all up lol."
"Together

The Long Walk"
"Apart from everything, I’m really interested to see del Toro’s Frankenstein."
"Respectfully, I don't agree. I've seen about 44 films that released this year and I've felt underwhelmed by the output. I've definitely seen stuff that I've liked: Sinners, Black Bag, 28 Years Later, The Ugly Stepsister, and whatnot. However, I haven't seen anything that I've loved so far and would consider Best of the Year worthy."
"Novocane is freaking awesome. Not ""go to the theater again"" awesome, but glad I watched it on Paramount in my own home awesome."
"To each their own, I guess"
I am usually a few years behind on movies but haven’t seen anything better than a 3/5 type movie yet.  Sinners or How to Train your Dragon is the best for me so far and they were pretty good but definitely not great.
Eddington is a 5 star movie
God I hated Mickey 17 
glad you didn't include superman.
"This year has been so bad, a bunch of ""okay"" movies."
"I'm glad people are finding stuff they love this year. It's been pretty meh to me. Movies others love like F1 and Black Bag I found to be good, but nothing special. Phoenician Scheme was entertaining, but just an average Wes Anderson movie. Jurassic World was pretty bad. TBF, I'm not a huge horror fan, and I think I've aged out of superhero movies, so I'm missing some big ones, and I still need to see Friendship and Eddington.

Funny enough, the movie that surprised me the most was Elio, which got mediocre reviews and underperformed at the box office. Still waiting for *that* movie this year. I'm holding out hope for OBAA and Train Dreams."
"I agree it's been a very good year, but no mention of **Bring Her Back** is downright criminal. IMHO, best movie of the year so far and nothing is all that close. F1 is the best popcorn blockbuster movie, but Bring Her Back is a masterpiece of cinema."
"It's definitely felt like a good year for movies. Been to the theater for The Accountant 2, F1 and Superman. Haven't been to the theater or had this much fun at one since about 2012 or so. That's not counting the streamers (Happy Gilmore 2, Sinners, etc) that have been extremely fun too."
"2022 was also a really strong year with The Batman, RRR, Nope, Barbarian, EEAAO, Top Gun, and Avatar"
jus waitin on Greenland Migration which seems to be held up again was supposed to release in March.. tf
"I don't agree so far.it has been servicable. However, I am feeling like there has not been a major stand out aside from on becoming a guinea fowl. I did love Sinners

2025 Films Ranked https://boxd.it/DKeGu"
"Great year but hasn't peaked like 2024\* yet for me, but the next few months is also when my favorite movies came out last year."
"It’s been ok. Nothing that makes it stand out as a great year really. 

Some of those movies you’ve heard good things about are just not great. If you heard good things about those films from people you know, I suggest you no longer take film recommendations from them. 

Also, if you’re going to talk about a year being great for film, you probably need to comment on more than the super mainstream stuff."
"I have to disagree. 2025 is a downgrade from 2024 thus far (though I haven't seen all the movies I wanted to yet, so that might change). But 2022 and 2023 are better than both imo"
Black Bag was a banger!
It really has not
Not a great year for the WWD Box Office though.
"I have seen only three movies from 2025 so far, which is too few to know if I would agree. The best one was Superman. The second best one starred a Superman and Star Trek voice actor. The worst one was a Star Trek movie."
"Honestly most of the movies you mention are just okey for me. Not bad, I enjoy going to watch them, but nothing particularly good either. But to be fair the first half of the year tends to be like this. It's usually in the second half where the movies from film festivals and from the Oscar race start to arrive to cinemas. 

I might just be spoiled because in the last few years by this time there were already movies like Dune 2, or Barbie and Oppenheimer that had been already in cinemas and felt truly like some of the best movies of the year. This year, for me at least, hasnt had anything like that. But, once again, might be just my taste in movies."
friendship is the best movie i’ve ever seen
"The Life of Chuck slapped, I wish everyone couldve gone and saw it"
"I agree. Ive watched about 30 films released in 2025. My top 5 are Freaky Tales, The Death of a Unicorn, Clown in a Cornfield, Companion, and 28 Years Later."
"2025 didn't have great first half, but hopefully better 2nd half"
Kpop demon hunters is like my new favorite movie...thought id just say that.
"no ones talking about eddington? i loved that one, that’s my favorite so far. looking forward to one battle after another and the running man."
Loved Dangerous Animals
Bring Her Back and Warfare were the best I've seen so far this year.
This comment is 28 Days Later from this post
No judgment but the movies you listed were mid at best and trash at worst. 
Ive seen so many movies this year compared to other years just saw F4 today
"I personally find this year underwhelming.  The only highlights for me were THE DAY THE EARTH BLEW UP (which thankfully made back its budget), and so far the soon upcoming LIGHT OF THE WORLD and WICKED PART 2.  Otherwise, this is a pretty disappointing lineup.  Too many sequels/remakes, not enough originality.  And the CG film fests are tiresome."
It's been a meh year so far. Phoenician Scheme is the best so far imo
That's.. a uh interesting list of great movies from this year lol.
"I don’t really agree, we still haven’t had a great movie in my opinion."
I think it's been one of the worst years in a long time thus far.
"Happy Gilmore 2 was phenomenal, humanity needed a comedy like that. God willing this means we get Apatow-esque contemporary comedies next"
"Agreed. Great movies all around. Superhero movies are amazing with Thunderbolts, Superman, and F4, blockbusters like F1; and movies like Companion, friendship, mission impossible, and final destination. 

Hopefully the Second half of the year follows."
This must be a bot post. Cinema has been a torrent of fecal matter for years.
"If forced to pick my favorite movie this year it’s prob Sinners but it’s tough. 2025 has been really strong, and I haven’t even seen F4 yet (tomorrow)."
"Everyone loves Sinners, I personally hated it."
"Personally disappointed with a ton but had a lotta fun with Lilo and stitch, Minecraft, superman, and Eddington!"
"Also this year has been extremely bountiful television-wise - Severance, Last of Us, Always Sunny, KOTH, Stranger things, etc. We're gonna have NOTHING to watch next year"
If you're a man-child with an IQ of 80 or less
"> But I’m glad I’m in the minority.

Lol...says the most upvoted post."
Horror is still enjoying their golden age lol
"Yeah... There only has been sinners and I enjoyed superman the rest was mediocre at best

I did enjoy my time watching Mission impossible but it was not good either"
Just a question why are you not enjoying this year so far?
"Seen the title and I was like I was just telling my wife all the movies this year are crap, unless your talking about the unicorn movie, best movie ever made! 😳"
Youre not in the minority. At least for film fans. Hard to gauge normies just because they see something doesn't mean they really like it. I still havent met anyone who thinks the Jurassic World movies are great but everyone keeps going to watch them.
2025 has sucked butt. There I said it.
"Was just talking about how horrible Friendship was and thought I'd do a refresher to see what other movies have come out in 2025.  I liked Mission Impossible, but looking at the list it made me realize that Hollywood is mostly dead."
"Sinners is my only 5 star movie this year, 2025 hasn’t sucked but everything has been so average e"
"Right, i was like what is this guy smoking? The only movie to me that was a can't miss was mission impossible"
"You're wrong, and that's okay!"
"Either your standards are pretty high, you have a narrower scope of genres you enjoy, or your AMC doesn’t show enough interesting movies. I don’t feel like I’ve taken advantage enough of my subscription this year and this is what I’ve seen:

- The Damned
- Presence
- One of Them Days
- Companion
- The Monkey
- Mickey 17
- Freaky Tales
- Parvulos: Children of the Apocalypse
- Sinners
- The Legend of Ochi
- Thunderbolts
- Drop
- Friendship
- Mission: Impossible 8
- Materialists
- The Life of Chuck
- 28 Years Later
- Eddington
- Superman
- Fantastic Four

All of these fell somewhere between good/interesting and great in my eyes. This list also doesn’t account for everything I intended to see and missed in theaters for various reasons (such as Wolf Man, Love Me, Heart Eyes, Jazzy, Last Breath, My Dead Friend Zoe, The Accidental Getaway Driver, On Becoming a Guinea Fowl, Black Bag, Novocaine, Ash, Bob Trevino Likes It, Warfare, Sacramento, The Wedding Banquet, Pavements, Clown in a Cornfield, Final Destination: Bloodlines, The Phoenician Scheme, Ballerina, Dangerous Animals, F1). Tomorrow I’m planning to see Sorry, Baby. Just in the next few weeks, I’m hyped for Together, The Naked Gun, and Weapons. And this doesn’t scratch the surface of the fall winter movies coming.

I’m far from saying 2025 is a special year in film, but in my own estimation it’s worth the price of A-list."
"Hmmm, may be differing tastes in films I thought this year was the most diverse pallets in a while I’ve watched so many different genres intentionally or unintentionally"
solid
Great
"Just searched it up looks kinda compelling, I just thought Jack Quaid was the guy from the boys but he seems to have range"
Naahhhh
I have watched it 5 times in the last 2 weeks and listening to the album every day. This movie has no right to be this good
Idk the over the top emoji faces made me cringe.
That sounds nutty I might have to try that
The is so wild to me. I couldn't even finish the trailer.
Word! SO good
"2023 is a very strong year in retrospect, I think we need to wait till December or even January next year before we can give it a final verdict"
Oppenheimer. American Fiction. The Holdovers. That was a good year.
I think 2026 will de-throne 2023. So many (likely) good movies coming out then
Those movies you named I don’t really connect to as much as this first half but I understand where you’re coming from
Not even sinners?
I’ve been thinking of getting a movie pass as well and I’m happy to see you’re getting your moneys worth
Yeah it does feel like we’re getting more original movies and a lot of horror too compared to other years
That movie went way too under the radar. Fantastic movie.
"Only film Ive watched this year I'd put in the good category, but I haven't seen materialists yet - that seems like a possible contender"
"Watched it in IMAX, was a hell of an experience. Anything Alex Garland is involved with is gold. Although I still need to watch Never Let Me Go and Dredd."
"100% the best film of the year, can't believe people said it was boring"
"Yeah I’m surprised about how many horror or suspense elements have been sprinkled all over this year, especially the reboots or continuations of legacy franchises like final destination or I know what you did last summer"
"Bring Her Back was great but hard to watch at moments. Clowns in  Cornfield and Final Destination delivered exactly what they should have, and I enjoyed them for that."
My dad always mentions it Every time I ask to go to one or he picks me up from one 
Weapons
"This long walk

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt10374610/"
"And that is completely fair, at least you’ve tried n watched so I can completely respect your standpoint"
I might have to try that out a lot of comments are sharing this sentiment
Why?
"I don’t think you’ve aged out of superhero movies I just think superhero movies in the past like 2 or 3 years of have mediocre or trying to target such a general audience that you get no audience 

But being a fan of comedies and dialogue, these films have been scratching my itch a little when it comes to the experience of laughing with friends or audience members in the theatre, one of them days really did that for me, looney tunes gave me a feeling back to childhood I didn’t think they could recreate anymore and the superhero movies have left me coming out of cinemas actually conversing with friends and different takes rather than the consensus “what the fuck were they thinking”"
"I had a really hard time rating this movie because I like horror, but I'm not the biggest fan of gore or some body horror. It was well made, actors did a great job, story was okish but the biggest problem was that it was just not entertaining for me. 

Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if they didn't reveal basically everything from the start."
I agree. Bring Her Back is by far the best film of the year.
Account 2 is one of the worst movies I’ve seen this year.   I liked the first one a lot
Barbarian for me is one of the best horror movies I've seen in the last decade. Was definitely shocked by it.
Couple movies I haven’t seen on that ranking like I didn’t even know there was a new Wallace n Gromit film but I can see we have differing taste n I respect that
Think you have a typo because you wrote 2025 instead of the year I’m guessing your referring to
"I mean I’m just coming from the standpoint of a more casual film viewer and me n my friends have enjoyed these films so far 

Saying to not take film recommendations from my friends is being a little pretentious no? Even if I don’t like the movies I should still experience them and form my own opinions rather than be uptight and disregard their taste"
"Fair, but still half way through the year so I hope you can find some films that would hit close for you"
"You should try more, I’m sure a fair few are coming to streaming services"
I loved F4 especially the retro futuristic look and how they actually treated the main 4 characters as people with different qualities rather than just quip machines or flanderising them
"Companion, Black Bag, Drop, Novocaine, Sinners, Warfare, Bring Her Back, Life of Chuck, Eddington, Materialists, F1.

Of the movies I’ve seen in theatres this year, less than half were sequels/remakes. The original movies are there."
I’d like to hear why? If that’s okay with you
Phenomenal is a bit extreme. I was pleasantly surprised but it still wasn’t above like a 6 or 7 out of 10
"I would love a freaks and geeks esque tv show for the 90’s or maybe 2000’s which could introduce a new generation of actors like they did for Linda Cardedillini, James Franco, Jason segel, Seth Rogen 
or even first significant roles like they did for Shila Labeouf"
"Happy Gilmore 2 was borderline unwatchable, but I'm glad some people seemed to liked it."
"I loved it, and I really didn’t expect to love it."
I wish it would have been released in theaters so badly. Seeing a comedy and just laughing your ass off with other people is the best
It really should have gotten a theatrical release instead of being treated like all the other Netflix content.
"Agreed that it was a very good mix of old comedy and new 

And the callbacks were very cobra Kai in their implementation"
"Bot post is crazy, ppl have different taste n it just happens the start of this year has had my flavour of ice cream"
"F4 is a strong movie for me, it’s the closest thing to a solo film you’d get in current MCU, no ties to the greater universe but I don’t wanna say anymore, enjoy the film"
How comes I found sinners to be amazing personally
Yeah I need to watch severance and been meaning to watch always sunny but haven’t found the time
lol if that’s how you feel man
Well I wish I was in the minority. Lol More good movies is good!
I came here via google search and thought I was on r/unpopularopinion
Pales in comparison to the 80s golden age though 
You seen bring her back? Same guys that made talk to me. Banger
And F1
sinner was absolutely terrible. How do people enjoy this film
Final Reckoning might be the most disappointing movie in the last 5-10 years for me.
"It’s been fine. Not many great or exceptional films. I wouldn’t consider a single film I’ve seen Best Picture quality (I haven’t see Sinners yet, I own that.) I thought 2024 was mid too."
"Superman only, shit even 28 Years Later was a disappointment for me. Maybe I’m just getting older but I’m starting to not care about movies like I once did."
"Because the movies that have come out have been terrible. It’s not that complicated they are bloated with CGI, badly written scripts, and lackluster performances."
He's right and that's ok
You’re both right and wrong just like me haha
"Everyone's tastes are different but Sinners is the only one of those I've seen and I haven't been to the theater for anything else other than Final Destination at the drive in. 

Last year seemed like I went every couple weeks!"
"I’ve seen almost all of those apart from any that haven’t shown in the UK and still think it’s been a mediocre year, a lot of those films were (imo) not bad just very average"
"All mid, nothing amazing."
Not a single one of these is great
You haven’t seen much Jack Quaid have you….
Poor jack quaid
Dude has incredible range. And he owns his nepo-baby status. Just an all around amazing dude. His episode as live-action Boimler in the Star Trek Strange New Worlds episode is a tour de force of acting prowess. Some great appearances on the [RedLetterMedia](https://youtu.be/eXVoHtbma0c?si=bnTp-9-E8lOAqCnY) YouTube channel as well.
"2023 was a good one. Oppenehimer and poor things were absolute bangers, and there was a solid number of good films"
to me they ruined it with the vampire plot so not over 7.
Was anything but boring. That film is probably the closest cinema will get to simulating a fraction of the stress and terror of combat. The two WIA was some of the best acting I’ve seen.
Clowns in Cornfield.... How do you watch a movie with less that 6 in IMDB
Yes. Loved the book by King.
"Yeah, fair enough. I'd recommend some though."
"You right, meant 2024."
"Idk to be honest not much interests me from the upcoming movies of this year. I'm definitely different than your average r/movies redditor though, so I understand why people are excited for movies like Weapons or whatever. I think the only ones that haven't yet released I'm looking forward to now are FNAF 2 and maybe Nobody 2 as a fun action movie but we already had several of those this year already"
"In time I probably will. I have already seen 18 from last year, several of which I saw this year."
Hah I mean fair it was not GOATed. But man i missed comedies like that.
Whaaaat? Unwatchable?
"Same. The original wasn’t even one of my like canon movies as a kid, but it really pushes all the buttons of classic Sandler comedies while also being kinda “with it”. It’s not just 90s Sandler with higher end cameras."
"I keep hearing it’s great, super excited"
have not seen that one yet!
"F1 was fine, but I swear it was a copy and paste of Ford vs Ferrari with some Gran Turismo and Rush mixed in."
I think it's over hyped and I personally would have prefered if they did not swap the Genre in the 2nd half  but I terrible?   No just alone the cinematography Performances and especially the coordination of the one music scene makes it worth a watch
"I actually quiet enjoyed it in the cinema but the more I think about it the more I dislike it

I dislike dead reckoning a lot more tho"
Come on. That’s such a disingenuous take. Best picture worthy films always come in q3 and q4.
"Hm fair take, me personally I’ve enjoyed the consistency I’ve been watching a lot of 7 or more out of 10 movies, but I’ve always liked dialogue or comedic films a lot so which is why I’ve connected to the first half of this year, especially one of them days I felt was sorely needed as a call back to those 90’s hood/comedy films like Friday"
Saying a whole year of movies is 'mid' says everything we need to know about your comment. It stinks.
"Yes, Life of Chuck, Sinners, and Warfare all had CGI, badly written scripts, and lacklustre performances."
"I’m 100% okay with everyone having different tastes and even those who think nothing in my list is worth watching. My reply was solely in response to A-list no longer being worth it. If you have A-list, I personally believe you should have some kind of adventurous spirit with movies if you want to get your value out of the program. And I don’t think anything about this year is different for that unless someone is solely expecting to watch the best movies."
"I think that’s a fair opinion. My comment was a reply to the value of A-list, not if it’s been a good year for film."
If you really believe not a single movie in that list is great then I don’t think the movies are the problem.
No not really he hasn’t been on my radar much
People on reddit really downvote anything try saying you didn’t know how good an actor was or how good he is n ppl react like their auntie got shot
"Yeah, there were more than I remembered. Anatomy of a Fall, Zone of Interest, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Godzilla Minus One were all that year too."
Barbie erasure
"""Common Side Effects"" was cool, probs worth the top of 2025. Rest is kinda hard, i don't know, feel like things repeat too much lately."
Because they can
It was so bad haha
"The plot is almost an exact copy of Sylvestor Stallone's ""Driven"" except it's Indycar. Someone cut the trailer of F1 to the movie Driven and it was pretty funny. I'm going to share the link. I didn't not like it though. It was still a fun movie. Is is the best thing ever? Nah, but it was alright. I liked Pitt's character. Link to the mashup trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0XlBrWaeUo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0XlBrWaeUo)"
I swear this would have been my movie of tge year if it remained plotless. Michael B Jordan and the soundtrack were so good. I wish they made a version of this without the vampire plot.
A majority can be as better films can be held back for Oscar runs but generally I have films from all year in my list. I have 5 films from the first half of last year on my 2024 list for example.
When did Oppenheimer come out
I wish I loved more! I’m jealous.
Give counter-examples.
You don’t think some years have more great movies than others and some years just aren’t strong overall? Really? So when someone says 1999 was one of the best years ever you just scoff?
It *was* mid though
Ah I didn’t even notice that part of his comment my bad I still get plenty of use out of my unlimited cinema pass I agree!
Great films are rare. They’re even more rare in a subpar film year like this one (so far)
"If you think any of those films are great you really have a very, very low bar for greatness."
"Barbie was a solid 6/10 film. Didn't hate it, but I think some of the praise it got was a bit overboard."
July. Q3
Eight year olds are using reddit nowadays?
Pretension is a stinky cologne. You relish bathing in it.
"It seems a lot of people felt that way but I thought it was an interesting, funny 8 at least.  Held its own as the second feature to Oppenheimer.

The contrast between the two, the happy shiny colors and comedy vs the somewhat brutal Oppenheimer, might have made me like it better."
Before where we currently are in the year
Well you're here so...
"Oh Jesus.

Move along."
Just take the L and shrink away
You’re wrong

----------------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Lindsey Bahr, and I’ve been a film reporter and critic for The Associated Press for over 10 years. I cover all things movies, including breaking news, the business of Hollywood, awards season and film festivals from Sundance to Venice. The filmmakers behind some of the summer’s biggest movies spoke to me about what to expect in 2025. Ask me anything about the summer movie lineup, what moviegoers should expect, what's getting attention in the industry and the history of summer box office hits and flops.

Some of my recent bylines and reviews:

Will be back on Thursday 5/29 at 12 PM ET to answer questions!"
What your thoughts on The Studio? How close it is to reality?
Which movie are you looking forward to the most this summer.  Is there a hidden gem that most haven't heard about yet?
"Is M3GAN 2.0’s release date of June 27, 2025 not a good choice on Universal’s end? It would be released just five days before Universal’s own Jurassic World Rebirth, a blockbuster that could impact subsequent holds for M3GAN 2.0 after the latter’s opening weekend. There’s also F1 releasing on the same weekend as M3GAN 2.0, which might be direct competition, given that they are both PG-13 movies. A lot of people believe F1 can be a sleeper hit due to being directed by the same guy behind Top Gun: Maverick, and the marketing Champaign. There’s also 28 Years Later, another horror film that comes out one week before M3GAN 2.0. What do you think? Do you think it’s fine where the film is at, or do you think the release date shouldn’t been at a less competitive spot?  "
"Is there a movie we should be looking forward to that's gone ""inder the radar""?"
"Hi Lindsey,

What are your thoughts on Jaws - the original Summer blockbuster?

  
And what do you think will be the biggest summer blockbuster of 2025?"
"Do you think the days of summer blockbusters routinely debuting to 100 million plus opening weekends are over? I keep seeing articles about Thunderbolts* disappointing box office, but I'm wondering if its opening is closer to a new norm. Especially with the quick turnaround to streaming."
what are the odds Sinners will get awards?
"Hi Lindsey! It's so amazing that you are a woman working in film criticism. As a woman who enjoys movies a lot, I often seek your reviews on things knowing we will align more in taste. I'd love to know what films shaped you and things you would love to come back into the culture via filmmaking."
"Hey Lindsey! Thanks for taking the time to do this! I've got a couple of questions, if that's okay?

Do you think the massive success of Lilo and Stitch will make Disney reverse their decision on pausing the upcoming live action remakes?

What's the most surprising award show win, in your opinion, from the last ten years?"
"How do you watch movies? Special screenings? Home theater with advanced copy? 
      
Or I guess do you even watch many of them upon release?"
"How did you get started as a reporter and end up as a film critic for the AP, and how would that happen today?"
"Hi Lindsey — longtime movie buff here. Summer tentpoles always dominate the conversation, but I’m curious: **Are there any smaller or mid-budget films this summer that you think could break out, either critically or commercially?** I love digging into under-the-radar gems before the hype hits. Anything you’ve seen or heard buzz about from the festival circuit or early screeners?

Thanks for doing this — looking forward to your insight!"
What are your thoughts on what Warner Brothers has been doing in shelving completed movies?
How do you think *Superman* would do? Gonna cross a bil for sure? Think it'd crush *Fantastic Four?*
Should The Dark Knight have at least been nominated for a best picture Oscar in 2008?
"Hi!

What do you think about studios banking on reboots rather than original stories with small budgets. What classics do feel should never be remade? Or are there reboots that you thought were a bad idea?"
Hi Lindsey! Hope you're doing well. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the progress of AI in this field and where you see it heading in the future.
What makes for a personal good movie experience? Any pre-show rituals to excite you? Also… do you think excessive trailers are lessening the movie-theater experience?
Why are movie critics ratings on movies generally so far off of regular viewers ratings of the same movie?
"What do you think today’s box office flops reveal about shifting audience values, and how might indie creators leverage that shift?

As a critic, what excites you most when you see an up-and-coming filmmaker’s debut? Is it voice, risk-taking, or something more intangible?

From your perspective, what is the current state/tone of industry conversation on how to responsibly integrate AI without undercutting artists?

What does your gut tell you about how the film industry is really evolving in response to rapid advances in tech and geopolitical turbulence? Where do you think it’s all headed? What advice would you give to a classroom filled with young artists hoping to engage within it?

Thanks for taking the time to do the AMA. 

-A grateful arts educator."
"Hi Lindsey,

Thank you so much for doing this AMA. I’m a student journalist who writes movie reviews for her college newspaper (I even won an award at the Journalism Association of Community Colleges conference this year for my review of Gladiator II).  My questions for you are:

What was your start in journalism like? What was your experience in college?

And what advice would you give for a student journalist who wants to continue writing entertainment news after graduation?

."
"Miss Bahr, 

Will studios start cutting excessive budgets so the films can be profitable within the current environment or is it too late for that?"
"Hello,

What do you anticipate to be some of the biggest releases this summer?

Thanks"
How often do you feel like you have to dumb down reviews for general audiences?
"How do you see the composition of summer blockbusters changing over the next few years? The summers of the 2010s seemed dominated by mega-franchises like Disney/Pixar, Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts, Transformers, F&F, and obviously Marvel, but basically all of those have ended or suffered serious declines in popularity."
"What's your pick for biggest summer blockbuster bummer, the movie that let audiences down completely?"
What qualifications should you possess in order to report on and critique film?
"What do you think of the box office possibilities for summer blockbusters? Are people back to watching in theaters or are they still dying a slow death? 

Also, any thoughts on the return of potential mid-budget comedies to theaters ever again?"
"Hey there!


If you could choose one movie (big or small) that you think deserves a great box office this summer, what movie do you want to champion?"
"What's the deal with the Ballerina review embargo, did they change it or not and what are these ""reaction but review"" embargo restriction guidelines?"
What in your opinion would help the theater business in general?
When do we get to see your picks in the Criterion Closet? 😊
Any thoughts about Luc Besson's upcoming Dracula?
"Thank you for doing this!

As a critic, how do you balance the ambitions of a movie with how seriously you take it in a review? 

Do you ever find it disheartening that the internet seems much more interesting in sharing and reading a scathing review instead of a glowing or mixed one?"
What's your favourite movie critic youtube channel and why is it Redlettermedia?
Are you optimistic that Superman will find a diverse audience?
"Hello, do critics have to show their blogs or do you have a resume of critiques?"
In your opinion will the box office longevity of a movie like Sinners have studios thinking more about investing in original movies with established directors or are they still mostly kryptonite to film financiers?
Is there a film you would consider the quintessential summer blockbuster? Why that specific film?
"What's your top 5 favourite movies?
What found footage movies you've liked?
Why rotten tomatoes's ratings are poor for the movies that majority people liked?
And thanks for your time🙏"
"How do you approach your role as a critic? Do you try to get into the mind of a specific genre's fans when evaluating it, or rely on more ""objective"" metrics?"
Any chance you'll get back to logging films on Letterboxd?

"I’m cautiously optimistic until proven wrong and so curious about so many movies this summer, whether they’re franchises, reboots or originals. As far as potential blockbusters go, “Superman,” “F1” and “Jurassic World Rebirth” are at the top of my list. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the Owen Grady years but am looking forward to whatever Gareth Edwards has done.  
  
As far as hidden gems, just speaking about films I’ve had the chance to see already and can vouch for: There’s a really lovely French romantic comedy called [“Jane Austen Wrecked My Life”](https://apnews.com/article/jane-austen-wrecked-my-life-movie-review-d1dad1bc037034859587a780067f9e82) that’s out in theaters now.

And finally, one of my absolute favorites of the year is “Sorry, Baby,” which is a really exciting debut from [writer-director-star Eva Victor](https://apnews.com/article/summer-movies-2025-breakout-stars-c10ca7245748efdd6b7173aad61e9106) that opens on June 27.

"I can’t pretend to know as much as the very smart distribution executives at all the studios, but out of most of those movies, I think “M3GAN 2.0” is the one that should be the least worried. Horror audiences are some of the most reliable around and hopefully it was made at a reasonable budget. The big question of the “M3GAN 2.0” weekend is whether enough people will choose “F1.” It being a packed summer might be a good thing for everyone, if the momentum stays — one of [the post-pandemic box office lessons](https://apnews.com/article/movie-box-office-lessons-2024-cbdff5fc420047d187987d2aeed4db9f) is that we don’t know everything anymore about a film’s prospects from its opening weekend alone. Counterprogramming can be a boost to everyone as we re-learned with “Barbenheimer.” Maybe someone needs to come up with [a catchy name for this one](https://apnews.com/article/glicked-barbenheimer-wicked-gladiator-c68ca8c7d9ac5acb2ea0e77bf0fce378).

We wouldn’t even be having this conversation if it weren’t for that movie. And there’s a whole generation of filmmakers operating at the highest levels now who were born into that world and are trying to recreate that thing that made them fall in love with movies in the first place — admirable and nearly impossible.  
  
I’ve actually never seen it on the big screen, so hopefully this is the summer I can right that wrong with the 50th anniversary re-release.  
  
As far as what will be the biggest this summer, it’s tricky since so many haven’t screened for reporters yet. In the past 15 years, many of the biggest movies have been family-oriented ones, so there’s certainly a chance that it could be “Lilo & Stitch” or “How to Train Your Dragon.” But I also wouldn’t count out “Jurassic World Rebirth”

"Were they ever that routine? Last year was a rough one for the $100 million opener, for a variety of reasons, but we’re talking about this the week after [“Lilo & Stitch” made $146 million](https://apnews.com/article/lilo-stich-mission-impossible-039dac917c7077a7dd23d7ca6349711b) in its first three days domestically. I think if that prospect was really over, we’d be seeing it reflected in the budgets of our summer blockbusters, which hasn’t happened yet.  
  
As far as “Thunderbolts” goes, Marvel is in a bit of a rebuilding phase. Perhaps the real test will come with “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” later this summer.  
  
The streaming and theatrical exclusivity question is a real one that the industry continues to grapple with. But no one is intentionally leaving money on the table. And sometimes the premium VOD rentals work to a film’s advantage, like with “Wicked” last year.

"Oh gosh, that’s very kind. I feel grateful to be working at a time when there are so many great female voices in criticism.  
  
It’s such an interesting question to think about formative films and I fear sounding a little silly and unoriginal but this is a safe space, right? I grew up watching the movies my family loved, the expected ones (“Star Wars,” “Indiana Jones”) and older movies (“The Adventures of Robin Hood,” “His Girl Friday”). I think [Sofia Coppola’s](https://apnews.com/article/sofia-coppola-priscilla-interview-be584d476c954556eb5706e954016d15) “The Virgin Suicides” came at a really formative time. I hung out with film majors in college and fell in love with David Lynch, Terrence Malick, Wim Wenders and all sorts of those now-obvious sounding choices of aspiring cinephiles. The fun thing about this job is you’re always learning and discovering.  
  
I’d love for there to be more smart romantic comedies from the next generation of Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephrons (keep an eye out for [“Materialists” this month from Celine Song](https://apnews.com/article/materialists-summer-movie-preview-13cee324b57cdb7d7ec1e9633bb84621)).

I do also go to the cineplex as well and am always astounded how many commercials there are before the movie begins.

"I went to journalism school but had a tough time finding a media job after graduation and took a few detours before trying again. I started freelancing (mostly for free) at a time when blogs like The Awl and The Hairpin were still thriving and The Atlantic was doing television recaps. I know it’s controversial to do work for free, but it was on top of a day job and it [got me a lot of bylines quickly](https://medium.com/the-hairpin/the-best-time-i-was-an-extra-on-dawsons-creek-3abd9b82c47c).  
  
Finally, I landed a job at Entertainment Weekly in Los Angeles, where I got a lot of opportunities quickly due to the fact that it was a small bureau and there were semi-frequent layoffs. A few years later, [the job at the AP](https://apnews.com/author/lindsey-bahr) opened up and I’m forever grateful that they took a chance on me.  
  
The media landscape didn’t seem great when I was starting out and it’s only gotten more difficult — so many of my talented friends are in a state of permanent freelancing. But I think there will always be jobs for young people starting out who are willing to roll up their sleeves and say yes to (most) everything. The question of longevity is the big one.

"An attentive crowd, probably. I’m not sure a packed house is always my favorite (this is a me problem but a too loud popcorn eater can really get under my skin), but when it works it really makes for a memorable time. One of my favorite experiences was at the premiere of “The Last Jedi” when a lone voice screamed out “WHAT” after the “hyperspace ram.” It was a joy.  
  
I enjoy trailers, but I do think that they go on far too long with all the other pre-show content. People don’t have 30 extra minutes for advertisements and the audience shouldn’t be annoyed when the movie finally starts.

"Congrats on the award! Sounds like you’re off to a great start already! I had a tough start in journalism, having somehow come out of journalism school with a nice degree but too few clips (my fault).

I would say that it makes all the difference to begin your entertainment journalism career in Los Angeles or New York. They’re expensive cities, but they will give you the best access to events and the people you need to know to try to break in. Also? Talk to everyone!

"For me, it’s probably “Jurassic Park,” which was my first real summer blockbuster experience in the movie theater. I’m certainly not alone in loving it and its influence continues to impact filmmakers, and not just because the franchise is ongoing.  
  
Gareth Edwards, who directed the upcoming “Jurassic World Rebirth” is a self-proclaimed superfan who is pretty sure he can recite the making-of doc word-for-word. For [our summer preview story](https://apnews.com/article/summer-movie-preview-2025-391fe8d40dc8680c18b2164cd1a5c7e4), he said, “Weirdly what’s great about doing a ‘Jurassic’ movie is that everybody knows deep down that like half the reason they’re in this business is because of that film and Steven’s work.”  
  
Even [Ryan Coogler cited it](https://apnews.com/article/sinners-movie-ryan-coogler-interview-2096a21ac759384a930fa1140348fd74) as a formative experience — a horror movie that no one would really think to categorize as a horror — and one he wanted to recreate with “Sinners.”

Thank you for the response I'm a writer myself but find it hard to write at the frequency enough to balance a job like that so I envy your success. Well deserved.
"Thank you, and I agree with all you said! An attentive crowd amplifies the emotions & communal experience. Also, 3 trailers MAX! Enjoy your next movie experience! :)"
It was connected to the U.S. president’s difficult decision >!about which city to nuke!<. I remember being quite surprised in the theater!
"He's excellent in the tv show The Great. I remember seeing him first in About A Boy, which him and Hugh Grant are good in."
"He is pretty iconic for a relatively young actor. Tony from Skins, Nux from Mad Max Fury Road. The Favourite. He would have deserved a nomination for Juror No 2 imo. I'm looking forward to his Lex Luthor"
No skins fans here?
It’s been weird watching him grow up. I remember him as the kid in About A Boy a long time ago.
"I just saw him in The Order, he plays the leader in a white supremacist group and was really good in that role"
The experience that was Renfield is absolutely delightful
I was keen on him ever since I saw him play a sympathetic zombie in a retelling of Romeo & Juliet.
"and THE FAVOURITE, and MAD MAX: FURY ROAD"
I love how strangely fucked up his character is in the menu.
He's got a ridiculously good filmography.
"Grew up watching him as Tony in Skins alongside Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out, Nope and Black Panther) and Kaya Scodelario (Maze Runner and Senna). 

Super proud of all three of them as I'm in their age bracket and have been following them for what feels like a lifetime"
"He's one of those people that is so effortlessly good in everything, that I convinced he's going to be a beloved character actor like a Giamatti or something. He's fantastic when he does small roles like in Fury Road or various X-Men movies or when he's a lead like in The Great, The Menu or Nosferatu. He's good in drama, comedy, rom coms, you name it."
Been a fan since About A Boy. Glad to see him having a strong career.
Warm Bodies is a great take on Romeo and Juliet. That's where I first saw him. He was great.
"The Menu was my first look at him and he played the annoying foodie perfectly. Great movie, funniest of that year for me."
"As talented as he is, he seems to be a really genuine, down-to-earth guy. He was a recent guest on Conan O’Brien’s podcast, and he came across as delightful and earnest."
Nobody seems to remember Warm Bodies
"He has a nice role in The Great, as well, very funny and tragic series"
He was the bestest Warboy
so hot right now
"I thought he was really good in Equals, with Kristen Stewart. And let's not forget About A Boy!"
Does nobody remember About A Boy anymore?
"My favorites are The Great & x-men, his range is amazing!"
Nuuuuux FTW
I also like him in The Banker a lot.
[removed]
He's an amazing actor. Phenomenal in The Great and in Fury Road among lots of other roles.
"I think he’s brilliant when cast right. 

One of his best performances is in “The Great” absolutely nails it."
He was the beast in xmen. Dude is a great actor
Don’t forget about Mad Max: Fury Road and The Favourite!
I think the first movie I noticed him in was X-men first class.
He's definitely on a hot streak.
Nicholas Hoult has poor luck with vampires it seems
"I’m so happy you posted this!

I’m the same age as him and have been following him since he was Tony in the British teen drama Skins. You knew the minute you saw him that he was going to be a star, and man, boy has he delivered. I think my personal favorite is Nux in Fury Road, but  I’ve seen all the ones you mentioned and agree he is fantastic. He’s great in Warm Bodies too!"
Not a single person mentioned Newness so far. It's so fucking good and he kills it in that movie.
"I’ve scrolled a while, but has no one mentioned The Great?

It’s a series, available on Hulu."
He was an amazing beast if you ask me
What a lovely day!
I’ve loved him since skins uk. Excellent actor
I really like him in Tolkien and I really enjoyed that movie though I never see it mentioned. I thought he did very well along with all of the cast
Love him in Mad Max: Fury Rd too
Witness me
He was the only good part of the menu.
"You should watch his most recent movie The Order, top notch!"
"If you like him, you should watch his “interview” with Brittany Broski’s royal court. It is very casual and longer than a lot of quick late night segments you see."
Watch him in Warm Bodies. Very good movie..not what you expect!
Hitting puberty was a gift to him. His look from About a Boy to Skins is incredible. I could not believe it was the same person. Same with Matthew Lewis changing in the Harry Potter movies.
"Impressive in Juror no. 2 (which is an amazing movie).
Great actor.
Always under the radar and out of the gossip."
"He had a killer few months. Juror #2, The Order and Nosferatu all within a few months. All of them are fantastic."
"He was good in The Menu too, bizarre film but worth a watch."
Xmen first class erasure
Thank you Mrs Holt.
"He is a great actor, I originally thought he was cast as a kid fir being so.... distinctive.. looking but he's also iust a super impressive and skilled actor."
"He, Harris Dickinson, Bill Skarsgard, Taron Egerton are our generation’s greatest yet so under-appreciated actors."
"Go watch ""Renfield"""
He also played Hank McCoy (Beast) in the X-Men prequel quadrology
"My brother was his body stand in for a short period of time.

If you see the back of his head in x men last stand that's him!"
Check out “Equals”
"The first time I saw him was in Kidulthood. 

Never thought he'd get to the point he is at now."
"Can't believe no one has mentioned him in Kill Your Friends! (Film adaptation of the book by John Niven) Not a masterpiece by any means, but a very fun movie nonetheless"
"decide elderly mysterious badge yoke oil swim waiting disarm recognise

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*"
"He was also Hank McCoy/Beast (blue and furry dude) in one of the X-Men movies.... I forget which one. With Janes McAvoy.

He had to wear a lot of prosthetics as Beast, so he sympathized with Skarsgard in Nosgeratu, as Skarsgard wore a ton of prosthetics for that. The behind the scenes stuff is fun."
"He actually gives me the creeps whenever I see him in a movie, but that might actually just be good acting lol.

To be fair, he almost exclusively plays slimeball creeps."
He has come a long way from About a Boy and Skins.
What was his first BIG movie role? X Men? Or Mad Max? Or something earlier
I wish he was a better Beast in the X Men movies
"I have no issue with Nicholas Hoult but he is badly miscast as Lex Luther, I don't know why they struggle to cast the character, they've never gotten it right."
"He's average at best, but it's nice that you like him so much."
"I really like him, but is he in too much stuff? Like over saturated? I get a little bored with the “It” actors getting all the roles after a while."
His comedic timing was perfect in The Great. One of the most loveable villains I've ever seen.
"Came here to mention The Great, on hulu. He effortlessly spits the most lengthy absurd raunchy dialogue with naïve glee that you cant help but laugh"
Also in skins
"It's ironic he first became known opposite Grant, because he's always seemed very Grant-like in his performances. Like Grant, he's equally adept at playing lovable everyman, complete assholes and charming likable jerks."

"He was wonderful in that! It wasn't the same after he 'died'.

I’m devastated that it was cancelled"
I remember being so unironically jealous he got to make out with Elle Fanning lmao.
"I remember first seeing him in season 1 of skins, that cast was stacked with great actors unknown at the time."
"He's superb in Kill Your Friends as well, such a horrible, odious character and you still kind of root for him"
"So much of the cast is absolutely brilliant in that show, but Hoult tops them all. The plot can drag on a little bit but it's absolutely worth it just to watch Elle Fanning and and Hoult together on the screen. Absolutely electric."
Kawabanga!
Mystie Kal?
Warm Bodies was a fun spin on zombie movies. His range is amazing.
Don’t forget The Menu
Also Beast in X-Men
"Yeah I was stoked to see he was cast as Lex Luthor. I think he'll be great for the role. My only small concern is that he tends to play really smart characters in a laid back, comedic kind of way. I'm interested to see if he can bring some of the serious, intense, ""I'm better than you and I'll force you to acknowledge it"" genius that Luthor usually embodies."
"He was excellent in The Great, as well. Also looking forward to him as Lex Luthor."
"Holy shit, he was Nux- lol... in retrospect, yeah, of course."
Juror number 2 was mid as hell
Came here to mention Skins. Tony was such a great prick
the confidence and command he has in that first episode is incredible
Me I was about to say that I know him from Skins lol
I’m rewatching for the first time in a decade or so. It’s still great but I’d be lying if it doesn’t make me feel incredible old now haha.
Most Americans haven't seen the British Skins. They made a really shitty American version on MTV. I'm pretty sure I had to torrent the UK version to watch it back in the day.
"About A Boy

[time passes]

Renfield 🤣"
Me too. I used to get him mixed up with Thomas Brodie-Sangster (I had to google the spelling of that 😂). He’s done very well for himself.
"I like About a Boy, but always thought he was terrible in that one! Maybe the awkwardness was real (or great casting) but ... oof"
"That movie was a lot better than I expected, quite liked it."
"I think Hoult was fantastic in the role, the role just felt underwritten to me. I wished he had had more to work with (same with the rest of the cast) because he really was fantastic and it would have been fun to see more out of him in that role"
God that movie was so perfect! I used to work more with personality disorders and I was laughing so hard they were spot on with everything!
Warm Bodies. So underrated.
Witness me!
"OH WHAT A DAY, WHAT A LOVELY DAY"
He was such a fucking asshole!!
Kaya is great in the series of The Gentlemen too
Also Dev Patel
Rrrrrrrrr
"My mom doesn't always develop crushes on actors, but he has been one of her crushes since that movie."
Took my wife to see that movie and she was confused thinking we were seeing world war z
Huzzah!
His work in that and Renfield really showed comedy chops.
Touche
"So true, I remember people thinking he was way too cute a child to end up a serious adult actor... well, lookit that."
"I mean, it’s a brand new DC Universe, so they probably wanna have him for a few movies, so it makes sense that they casted a young guy, I know most people see Lex Luthor as a middle aged dude, but so far his young take on Lex looks way better than Jesse Eisenberg’s"
Huzzah!
"""Because I am of gentle heart, and massive cock."""
"His bewilderment at Catherine’s empathy and her rejections of him were so funny.  Also, when he “returns” her lover after surrendering. 

He really created an otherness to the Russian royalty."
My dumbass didn't realize that he also played Pugachev lmao. He did so well in balancing more than 1 personality in that show
Such an underrated show. Loved it.
I always felt like the great was grown up Tony if he never had the accident.
He’s spoken in a few interviews about how he’s taken more than a few cues from Grant. I guess it would be impossible not to when he was that young and acting across from the guy.
"""I'm lonely. I'm lost. I mean, I'm literally lost, I've never been in this part of the airport before."""
That was my first introduction to Nicholas Hoult. Nice little movie but the book was better.
"
That film & his performance in it makes me hope he can revisit the genre again in some Santa Clarita Diet -esque show/film"
Warm Bodies was my introduction to him. Even as a zombie he was cute!
"Reminds me of him playing Tesla in The Current War.

Now playing the Tesla CEO in Superman."
worst movie i've seen this year. everyone who says it's good really need to have their head examined.
"Crushed it in that role, and as the exact opposite in season 2"
No Americans saw the American version. lol.
"I find it really difficult how skins would translate to an American version, there are so many specifically English things about it"
"Count Orrrrrrrlock:   ""You must be... Nicholas Hoult. Hmmmmmm the smell of Ellen.""

Nicholas Hoult: ""You do not scare me, vampire. Awkwafina and I beat the shit out of one of you kind. Leave my wife's name! out of your fucking mouth!"""
"He was amazing, and he played the awkward kid perfectly"
"Same. It never reached great highs but Hoult, Law and Sheridan were all excellent"
Loved the movie but not given the series a chance yet. Worth watching soon?
"Yup, Dev went on to star in Slumdog Millionaire (2008)"
"He has elevated two vampire movies with his sweaty, panicky acting. Love that for him."
He and his management team were very careful with their projects and it worked.
Indeed! 
He’s definitely channeling evil Tony in that Superman trailer
"It's not just you, I definitely got that vibe from the great"
I think it was made for alcoholics that  that have fucked up big time. I personally love it. Even though I haven’t hit anyone one with a car
"He directed, wrote and starred in his first movie Monkey Man last year too. And its actually a very good film. Insanely good when you know its his first directorial effort. Tbh Patel until semi- recently probably enjoyed the best career post skins.


Marigold Hotel (1&2), Lion, The Newsroom, Hotel Mumbai, Chappie, The Road Within, The Man Who Knew Infinity.


Kaluuya and Hoult have overtaken him now, especially Kaluuya with all his awards recognitions. And Hoult has more high profile roles at a quicker rate, but Dev is also there making strides in his own ways."
And Dev was just got his 3rd BAFTA nomination in the best British debut category for Monkey Man
Shout out to Jurassic Park. That score hitting with the dinosaur reveal is magic.
“*The Indiana Jones March*” will always be my favourite.
Superman will always put a smile on my face. With Jurassic Park being a close second.
“Map Room at Dawn”
Got to see him at Tanglewood with James Earl Jones narrating Star Wars.  Special guest at the end: Spielberg.
"Honestly I think I watch The Empire Strikes Back for the music more than anything. The Imperial March, the asteroid field, the escape from Cloud City. Just banger after banger."
Jaws
The Imperial (Death) March from that movie about space
"[https://youtu.be/8v6UVKPxgFQ?si=cfdHtSxuoKNjOKHn](https://youtu.be/8v6UVKPxgFQ?si=cfdHtSxuoKNjOKHn)

I specifically love how this feels influenced by the Jaws theme.

Also Buckbeaks flight:  
[https://youtu.be/gMoX0M29mlg?si=turp7kFlECZtPY\_o](https://youtu.be/gMoX0M29mlg?si=turp7kFlECZtPY_o)

Really though the whole soundtrack for Prisoner of Azkaban is superb, there's a reason he's the king."
Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"Before I knew who John Williams was, before I knew what a composer was, teeny tiny Mongo walked into a dark theater and heard the opening theme to Star Wars. That will always hold a special place. 

And then the theme from Superman. When my little mongos were barely walking I’d put that on and ‘fly’ them around the house. Those memories just can’t be touched. "
"Hard to beat the *Jaws* theme. The music that made John Williams, John Williams."
Home Alone!!
"Honestly, I don’t think I could choose just one - his catalog is too rich with number one choices."
How in the world has no one mentioned The Asteroid Field track from The Empire Strikes Back. Just thinking about it has me swishing my left hand through the rooms of my home.
"They’re all really good. Incredibly difficult to pick a favorite and he is a master at creating memorable motifs and melodies.

Surprised they didn’t also play stuff from Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, and even The Fablemans but I’m sure they had a time limit to stick to."
"I have fond memories of ET


It was one of the first and few CDs I had for my walkman CD player growing up"
"Most of Star Wars. 

Duel of the Fates is iconic, even if a bit meme-y."
"Favourite pieces -

""DESERT CHASE"" - Raiders of the Lost Ark

""SLAVE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE"" - Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom

""THE KEEPER OF THE GRAIL"" - Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

""JOURNEY TO THE ISLAND"" - Jurassic Park

""THE LOST WORLD"" - The Lost World: Jurassic Park

""DUEL OF FATES"" - Star Wars - The Phantom Menace"
"The introduction in E.T. 8 amazing minutes!


https://youtu.be/XrTm9pYfbgo?si=Qz_HRe8BJq_nYfl-"
"I have a soft spot for his march from “1941.”

It feels like it could have becoming some new American theme.

In 2008, I and some of my family got to see Williams conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The highlight was seeing him conduct the end music from E.T."
One of my favorites is his unique score for Altman's **The Long Goodbye**.
"Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Jaws is cool alright but _Somewhere In My Memory_ AKA the Home Alone theme is my all-time favourite John Williams soundtrack."
The Accidental Tourist is often overlooked among his scores. I quite enjoy it.
Catch me if you Can is so underrated by Williams
"The rainbow music in ET
And the cemetary scene in Schindlers
Christ saw those both in theatres back in the day. Intense"
I was there also!  Great show.  Loved when they did Star Wars at the end (don't know the exact title) and everyone was waving their light sabers.  Fun time.
"[Honestly, I think the stuff that came out of his family sessions is hands down his best work.](https://youtu.be/pnqH-atn52c?si=4cuMs_5jdGRNTrMY)

Bom bom bom BOM bom Bom!"
"For me it's the scene in Jurassic Park when Dr Grant, Sattler, and Macolm see the dinosaurs for the first time. It almost brings a tear to the eye. I wish I was old enough to see it in cinema back in 93'.."
"Superman (1978)

Love the main theme (truly makes you believe a man can fly), but also love the Krypton fanfare that introduces the appearance of the planet Krypton."
"Our son got to participate in a John Williams night with his wind ensemble and got so into it, I rewarded him with John Williams night at the Rady Shell in San Diego with the symphony. We’ve listened to a lot of John Williams. My personal favorites are Schindler’s List, ET, Born on the Fourth of July and The Duel Begins from one of the Star Wars movies (that one was particularly fun to watch our son perform)"
Star Wars.   The Empire's music to be specific.
"It's definately forgotten that Williams wrote the score to Oliver Stones JFK. The snare drum roll that opens the film, along with the narration and montage of JFK's life and achievements, is masterful. A full on score that reflects the suspense films of the 50's and 60""s, it's a wonderful piece of work for a very different director."
"Imperial March is my favourite, the two note Jaws is pure genius.

When has any other composer done so much with so little. Perfect."
Just a shout out to John Williams' more romantic contributions in [Leia's Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyHOUMWw5_M) and [Marion's Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgkswCoo9f4).
"I believe it was a Fox executive, possibly Gareth Wigan, who said that as soon as the music and opening crawl for Star Wars began, he knew it was going to be the greatest movie ever made, because only the greatest movie ever could have inspired such glorious music.

He went home and told his family ""I want you to remember this day, because this is the day that everything about movies has changed"" (or words to that effect)."
"Hey OP. I know I’m not answering your question directly, but the two-note shark motif in Jaws is - in my view - the single most genius musical scoring in the past century. How on earth do you come up with something so perfect?"
"“You Are the Pan” from Hook. 

“Cadillac of the Skies” from empire of the sun"
"End Credits to Jaws is just the sweetest, most wholesome thing I've ever heard."
"'No Ticket' from The Last Crusade was so good he reused it for the duelling scene in Chamber Of Secrets.



But I think [Indy's Very First Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8OZ5F59ScQ) is just the perfect movie score."
Not enough mention of The Last Samurai in this discussion. In fact I'm the first to mention it. Unacceptable! Not a single skippable track on the soundtrack.
"My favorite overall score of his is the original Star Wars, but as far as just one scene goes, I'd say his [15-minute piece for the climax of ET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5DOMLYqd6E) is his magnum opus."
"I was thinking about this the other day and I wouldn't even say it's my favorite one, but something about Hedwig's Theme and the Harry Potter just resonates with me in a way that is hard to describe. It's probably just nostalgia because of the different ages that I experienced different Harry Potter books and movies throughout my life... But with Harry Potter, John Williams is perfectly capturing the ethos and wonder of the wizarding world. That song IS Harry Potter for me in a way that stands out from his other works."
I've always loved his scores to Towering Inferno and Dracula and think they'd be awesome with a live orchadtra
"A New Hope, Luke’s theme playing as he watches the suns setting on Tatooine."
Tie fighter attack
"For me it's Superman. There's probably no such thing as a ""perfect"" film score, but that one comes damn close."
"As a whole, and because there's so much of it, his Star Wars stuff is just overall so great. 


Though, when it comes down to a singular piece, his Superman theme is just so... Uplifting and exciting. 

I went to a local symphony show where they played John Williams music. Obviously, they played a bunch of Star wars stuff and other things. I was bummed not seeing the Superman theme in the program. 

It was the encore. I was pumped."
Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets - that soundtrack is the entire reason I became a musician
Superman.
Empire
"Dual of the Fates, with the Tattooine sunset being a close second (the former wins for being longer and more fleshed out)"
"Too many bangers to name, but *Into the Trap* from Jedi is a favorite of mine I don't see posted yet."
E.T. when the bikes all fly!! God that has to be in some kind of GOAT conversation
"For me, it was the Yub-Yub song at the end of Jedi --- but I recently found out that it was composed by John Williams' son, the lead singer of Toto!"
‘The Asteroid Field’ from The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite piece of music from a film.
The Mission
The whole scene from the helicopter to when they see the dinosaurs for the first time in Jurassic Park. Literal chills every time.
"It always makes me misty eyed, and I’ve seen it a dozen times. Pure corns magic ❤️🦕🦖"
"I went to go see the new Jurassic movie and it was pretty dreadful but when that score came up, it still hit. Same with the new Superman movie."
Yeah that one just fills your spirit with a sense of wonder and adventure. It's just so perfect.
They did Superman...  I forgot. not jurassic but was hoping for it
The incredible thing about Superman is that he already existed in pop culture for *40 years* when the 1978 movie came out. You'd think it would be hard to create iconic music for something so well known. But now that music *is* Superman.
This piece gets me so hype
I like to listen to that at museums and ancient ruins.
Probably this whole scene. It's magic from start to finish musically and cinematically
This metalhead cranks The Asteroid Chase at my house! Amazing passage. Yeah you're right. Banger after banger.
"The stretch from the Battle of Hoth through the asteroid chase isn't just the greatest sustained stretch of pre-digital VFX ever put on film, it's also one of the greatest sustained stretches of film scoring ever."
they did that as an encore :)
"Buckbeak's Flight is peak, amplified by the fact that it's the only moment of joy in the whole goddamn movie saga"
The new superman uses that score...  because it's so perfect it would be a distraction to use anything else.
"It evokes such a complex mix of emotions that perfectly encapsulate the movie and Kevin.. Naughtiness, innocence, resilience, family and most importantly, Christmas!"
Came here to say this.
Thank you for bringing this one up.
"Such a great score! A couple years ago I took my girlfriend to see the Chicago Symphony Orchestra perform a screening of the film and it was fantastic! Even better is the night before, we watched a screening of it at the church in Oak Park for the church interiors (it was a different church for the exterior where he hides in the nativity) and I watched it from the seat Old Man Marley as sitting in. 

But the very end when Kevin’s looking out the window and Marley’s reconciling with his son, gives Kevin a wave, and the score swells…damn near brings a tear to my eyes every time!"
Yeah there's just too much.  I was hoping for Jurassic but maybe next year.
"Near the end of the theme where the music builds to extremely loud and the goes very soft and quiet and then becomes very melodic, I get chills and tear up every. Damn. Time.  Old enough that I saw it on release in the theater.  10/10.  Defining moment for my love of movies and great scores."
Didn't know he did that.  Just saw it recently in theaters. I should have paid more attention to the score.
"On the new Blank Check podcast Seth Rogan talks about grilling John Williams for minutes about that score, and how Williams was disappointed that how they used the song in the film didn't become a trend in movie scores. Now I have to watch that film"
"Yup, this scene always gives me goosebumps 

Spoiler for the end of [Accident Tourist](https://youtu.be/WIAyGmaGnHs?si=Fj1Jn0eHNvvQIiZp)"
I saw that score performed live. Just incredible.
I was hoping he was going to keep coming out even more for encores lol...
And they didn't do it.  They did other parts from Jaws but no that. I was surprised they didn't pop it in somewhere even as a joke.
Isn't that Ennio Morricone?
That perfect 80s optimism.
I think that’s because they did the entire Jurassic Park movie live the other day!
[deleted]
Wolf man and dog man coming out the same month is hilarious
">**The Fantastic Four: First Steps**

>The Fourth Remake of the characters based on the comics, and the 5th Movie, this film will serve as the 37th film in the MCU and their introduction to it

FF isn't a *remake*, it's the fourth *adaptation* of the characters and it's also *technically* only the 4th FF movie as the Roger Corman one (despite having been bootlegged and easily viewable for 2 decades) has never officially been released.

Yes, I am being extremely pedantic :P"
"M3gan released in 2023, not 2020"
"Lethal Weapon 5 might swap with Passion of the Christ 2. Either will be Mel Gibsons next film, it’s just which one happens first. 


That being said, lists like these always make me realize how much original content we get. Like seriously how many wide release films roll out each year? 700? Prequels/sequels/remakes/reboots are only a fraction of what we get."
"Rebooting Naked Gun sounds like the worst idea of the century already. It does NOT need a remake.

A remake of the Running Man that is more faithful to the book is something I have asked for for many years however, and I am very excited if they can pull it off. And the original Arnold movie will not be belittled by it because it is its own thing."
This says The Wonderful Wizard of Oz book came out in 1990… that’s 90 years too late.
"Do we have a list of original movies that are not spin-off, sequel, prequel, remake, or adaptation of popular IP?"
"Why include a bunch of films that aren't a spin-off, sequel, prequel or remake?

Stuff like Minecraft is simply the first adaptation based on that game."
"Can you elaborate on Until Dawns description? I'm aware of the VR spin off, but not the prequel or sequel?"
"Weird..pretty sure i saw dirty dancing 2 decades ago


Also..what we really need is A new stargate show, and Babylon 5"
Entertainment industry is in play it safe mode right now and sequels and spin offs are a safe bet
Excited for M3gan
Easier to list the ones that aren’t…
The Den of Thieves sequel is next month.
"A nitpick but it’s only the 9th Superman film:

1) Superman: The Movie

2) Superman 2

3) Superman 3

4) Superman 4

5) Superman Returns

6) Man of Steel

7) BvS

8) Justice League

9) James Gunn’s Superman 

I guess tenth if you count the Snyder Cut"
"Love the list, but Paddington 3 need to be on here for the US"
Saw XI has very little chance of coming out in 2025 with rumored behind the scenes drama pretty much halting production at script level.
I know watching both the Sully Na'vi clan and the humans getting cooked by the evil Na'vi is going to look glorious in IMAX 3D.
Has no idea they were making an until dawn movie
"Super hyped for Final Destination, though it'll be hard to top the 5th one."
Gee thanks.
"Man,how certain are we that The Accountant is for the first half of the year? There is zero marketing push or a trailer."
Paddington 3 is missing from the list.
"There is so much to look forward to next year, even with franchises and IP."
"The Superman trailer got me excited, and I loved Knives Out and really enjoyed the sequel so I’m excited for more. Freakier Friday is such an unneeded sequel that I’m excited to see how they do that."
I think you meant to write ‘story within a story’ with *Dog Man*.
"Captain America: Brave New World

How is this the first time I read about it"
Section 31 looks like an absolute dumpster fire. An anti-Star Trek. I hope it loses so much money.
"I'm sorry, I appreciate the effort but this is a pretty poor list with several films that are not sequels/prequels/remakes/etc"
I thought the knives out 3 is the final film of the franchise
">The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection 

Lol please end me, why is the title like this and why is it on a list of spin-offs and sequels. It's not the Bible cinematic universe. It's a religious/semi historical event. It's like calling any movie about WW2 a spin off or something"
Aka least appealing film releases coming in 2025. We want new ideas.
The reboot of the reboot from 10 years ago needs a sequel
"That's what 2024 has mostly been and what this year us looking like it'll be again.


Hollywood barely does anything original anymore. Gotta rely on Indie films more for originality."
Absolutely dire. 
Jfc this is terrible. Hollywood is devoid of new ideas.
Jesus Christ. No wonder I don’t go to the movies anymore
Is the first re-sequel?
Night bitch should've been pushed back
"How many people will mistakenly walk into the wrong screening, I wonder."
"This reminds me of an Arrested Development line when Kitty finally gets some power:

""I wanna remake Spider-Man 2. The first one."""
"Superman also isn’t a sequel, prequel or remake seen as how it’s the start of a brand new franchise and as far as we know of, it isn’t a remake of any previous Superman film that has come before it either."
">FF isn't a remake, it's the fourth adaptation of the characters 

Isn’t that a reboot tho? I would count those if you count spin-offs and remakes"
Good point well made!
"Naked Gun is a sequel, I believe. Liam Neeson plays Frank Drebin Jr. "
Seth McFarlen is in charge of the Naked Gun sequel and I think that is not a good sign.
yeah your never finding a suitable replacment for lesley neelson. lets be real though. they will slap the rock and kevin heart in there wont they. typical hollywood bs
"Fixed it, thank you!"
OP definitely used AI for this 💯
This list has a ton: [https://thefilmstage.com/the-100-most-anticipated-films-of-2025-part-one/](https://thefilmstage.com/the-100-most-anticipated-films-of-2025-part-one/)
Isn't that a spin off of the game?
"There are two Until Dawn VR games—one prequel (The Inpatient) and one spin-off (Rush of Blood). The ""spiritual successor sequel"" is definitely referring to The Quarry, which is really stretching it. It's a similar formula and the same developers, but it is not connected to Until Dawn in any formal way."
The other Dirty Dancing was a prequel
Counting the Snyder Cut but not the Richard Donner cut? Blasphemy.
I might have accidentally done that yeah!
Paddington 3 is a 2024 release
Thank you! Fixed it
"It's not theatrical, so it won't lose money in the usual sense. What I'm afraid of, though, is that the dummies at Paramount will see the terrible streaming numbers and decide that people just don't want Star Trek -- when they just cancelled LD, which we definitely do want more of."
It's direct-to-streaming.
Based in existing IP I guess would be a better title
Final one contracted with Netflix. I think Johnson and Craig have both expressed continuing.
It's a sequel to **The Passion of the Christ**
new ideas don’t sell tickets
"Well, some of these are barely remakes.

The Running Man is a different adaptation of the book, which was nothing like the 1987 film version.

Last Breath is a narrative film based on true events, of which there is a documentary on. So if I make my own 9/11 movie using real people, then it's a ""remake"" because these people have already been documented?

The Amateur is based on an obscure 1981 film that was neither a box office hit or got good reviews. The studio is hardly using nostalgia or a brand to sell this film as 99% of people going into this will not realize there was another adaptation.

I could probably bring up like 40 films from 1939 which would fit the OP's criteria."
"This is a fraction of the films coming out next year. 

The vast majority of content we get is original."
Does No Way Home not quality for this?
Dont know about first but Star Wars episode 7 is basically a re-quel
The Thing (2014) is a re- prequel
"It's part of an already-established franchise though, so while it isn't technically a sequel, prequel, or remake, it still fits the spirit of the list."
"Reboot, yes. Remake, no."
Naked Gun also supposedly is a sequel/continuation since it will feature the son of Frank Drebin
Liam Neeson!
OP definitely didn't
"It’s based on the game but in terms of movies it’s not a sequel, prequel or remake just like Until Dawn isn’t because it’s the first time these properties are being adapted on the big screen so I wouldn’t count them as any of the things OP has counted them as so I don’t understand why they are on the list from my personal point of view."
"I totally forgot The Inpatient. But yeah, if The Quarry is a ""spiritual sequel"" what about the four Dark Pictures games Supermassive have also made since UD?"
"It was marketed and built as a spiritual successor, which is why I mentioned it. One was birthed from the success of the other"
"There have already been 3 films released in this franchise, this would be #4… assuming it ever gets made. The latest report is that they haven’t been able to come up with a story yet, and that was just reported a month ago, so don’t hold your breath on this one.

https://variety.com/2024/film/news/jennifer-grey-dirty-dancing-sequel-update-nailed-down-1236178216/"
Ah I didnt know it was released somewhere. We are getting it in january.
"They’ll never cancel Star Trek itself. It’s one of Paramount’s main IPs to exploit.  They’ll be making Trek shows 200 years from now on VR implant holographic streaming, or whatever medium TV is broadcast on. "
"Yeah, that's a better description for sure! Again, I appreciate that you took the effort to type them out and write a little description."
"It'd be a shame for Netflix if they let the franchise go, but I also get why they would.  They took a bath on the cost of the sequels."
Well that's what it's all about right? Making money?
Yet all here are derivative. Do you not agree?
Oh yeah you got it that is one
"I am thinking way too hard about this, so keep that in mind...

No Way Home is not a re-quel. It is a sequel (the second) to a reboot, yes, but it is not a reboot. What it is though is a sequel to 3 franchises. No Way Home is the first ever ""Cube-quel""

Karate Kid: Legacy is different. All it really is is a sequel. Chan's Karate Kid is a stand-alone movie, but it can comfortably live alongside the canon of the original series. Thus, the upcoming KK is just another entry in the same series in the same way that Ballerina is another entry, if an off-shoot. So... maybe you could call it a ""Spin-quel""?

Someone below brought up Star Wars VII as an example of a ""Re-quel"" and I don't really agree with that either. After all, it is Episode 7. That'd be like calling Episode 1 a Re-quel (or a Pre-re-quel).

I posit Ghostbusters: Whatever It's Subtitle Is as a true Re-quel. I've never seen it though, so I might be wrong."
"I mean, if it’s the very first movie of that franchise, I don’t think I would say it’s already-established"
Then you either write like AI or you are AI and don’t know it😂
"Right, it's not a sequel, prequel, or remake. It's a spinoff. It exactly matches the definition of a spinoff, not sure what else is needed."
"Also the OP is kinda misleading and probably wants karma points from people who don't actually watch movies that chime in with ""Hollywood is out of ideas!"".

I mean, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof or The Big Sleep are based on existing IP. They would fit the OP's criteria if it was about films from 1958 and 1946."
Yes.  Hollywood is a commercial industry
"(Also thinking too hard about this) I would argue up until this point the Jackie Chan Karate Kid was really just considered a modern-day reboot in China.  I don't believe it was officially confirmed to be the same universe until this movie was announced, which I would say qualifies Legends as a unique re-sequel since it's the thing officially bringing the reboot into the same canon as the original.  It is definitively a sequel to Chan's and another entry in the mainline Karate Kid franchise, which were previously implied to be separate.

No Way Home is a weird circumstance since it's a sequel to one franchise that acknowledges other franchises as separate entities and different universes.  I'd call it a crossover sequel since it creates a shared canon but I don't think it can reasonably be said to be a sequel Tobey and Andrew's franchises, only Tom's since the others are visitors from other universes.

When people say requel I think they're blending the line between sequel and reboot.  It's a spiritual reboot that's still technically in the same universe and has sequel elements.  Scream 5 refers to itself as such: new batch of main characters but the original characters still come back.  The new Ghostbusters would also apply.  Force Awakens sort of has that quality since the plot and general strokes of it are kind of like a soft reboot of the original film but I feel like it's more arguably a direct sequel, just with a similar story and characters. Legacy sequel is also a term that muddies the waters here, it's pretty close to requel but I feel like the main difference is a lot of time passing between entries, more applicable to Ghostbusters than Scream.  All of this is under the same umbrella as sequel, though, it's just an additional distinction."
"Maybe we're using different definitions of ""franchise"", but I'm using it broadly to refer ""Superman"" as an institution and cultural phenomenon. It has a built-in fanbase that comes with it that a truly original work doesn't have, even if it's the first of this particular continuity or iteration"
Just tried to write it as unbiased as I could
"I don't know. If Frankenstein were being made for the first time, I don't think we'd classify it as a spinoff -- it would be an adaptation. It seems like the only reason to use spinoff with Minecraft is because it's a video game."
A spinoff has to be part of the same medium. A movie based off a game is an adaptation.
"It isn't a spin-off. Any film based on a videogame or book or stage play or anything of that sort, is an adaptation. It's been adapted into a film.

That's not what a spin-off is.

A spin-off is something like Furiosa. She first appears in the 4th mainline film, which was itself a soft reboot. Her film is a prequel, and a spin-off from the main films, which have previously always been centred around Max.

Thunderbolts is a multi-pronged spin-off. Each of the members are previous supporting characters, such as villains or secondary allies. Now, they've got their own spin-off focusing on them forming a weird team.

Recently, Marvel released Agatha All Along. That series is a direct spin-off featuring a character that first appeared in WandaVision. It isn't a wholly new thing, because there's multiple characters who have appeared before and it's part of that shared world. It isn't a prequel. It isn't a direct sequel, as it's a narrative kickstarted by but otherwise separate from the previous show."
"I'm not saying whether this is a good or bad thing, just listing them"
Which is why most Hollywood films are recycled rehashed crap driven by focus groups and accountants rather than artists.
My mistake. There are just minor mistakes and whatnot that are similar to the kinds that I see from Chat gpt. I applogize
Is the Minecraft movie the same storyline as the game?
"Lol based on your own definition, maybe."
"Spin off has a definition and this fits the definition, regardless of what you think it means."
"Minecraft doesn't even have a story, unless that's changed in recent years."
"Nah you're wrong and should learn to take in new information :)

Absolutely no one calls an initial film or show based on anything a ""spin-off"" of that thing."
"Not a complex story, but there is some progression towards a final boss fight, even if the game doesn't make it obvious. So maybe?

I'm not very well versed in Minecraft, mind you."
So it's an original story based on another media property. That's a spin-off.
"They do. It's literally the definition. Not yours apparently, but the actual one."
"Yeah it's just that, get to the other realm and defeat the Enderdragon. There isn't a film in that though lol"
"So you'd classify Mary Poppins, for example, as a spinoff?


Spinoffs are generally classified taking a side character in one story and making them the main character in another. Frasier Crane or George Jefferson. Even Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.


An adaptation is taking a story from one medium and producing it in another. That's why the Oscar is for Best Adapted Screenplay, not best spinoff."
"This is some r/Iamverysmart stuff here.

Mary Poppins is a combination of stories that already exist. So no, that's not the same. Not really even close. The Minecraft movie is not a story from the game."
"This is going to sound pretentious, but none of them 😭"
"I already have my tickets to Superman.

Also, probably The Naked Gun."
Happy Gilmore 2 isn't being released in theaters.
Of these? Superman and Jurassic World. But Blockbusters are a dying art. I am much more excited for the dramas and indie films coming out this year/teasing the awards season
All of them.
Jurassic world rebirth & Superman.
Fantastic four. Not just one star stealing the whole show
I will see all of this except Bambi.
"Meh. Maybe Superman if it had good enough reviews. Maybe Naked Gun if it had good enough review.

I take it as a given that most the others will be middling to bad otherwise."
Happy gilmore isn't coming out in theatres
None but I'll take my little boy to superman as I saw him fighting a godzilla style monster in the trailer.
"I am Legend 2 is not coming out in 2025.

Happy Gilmore 2 is coming exclusively to Netflix, and will not play in theaters.

I had to Google Zero A.D. in order to be able to say that I have zero interest.

I’m assuming that Bambi: The Reckoning is a joke.

So that shortens the list of options by quite a lot for me."
None of them appeal to me.
Superman -- but mostly because there are a bunch of Cleveland locations in it and I want to see how they look.
"I don't really care about any of them

Maybe Superman if the reviews are good."
"Superman, Fantastic Four and maybe Tron"
"None, I just don't  understand what happened to cinema? I mean people were sick of prequels sequels and reimaginings a decade ago. How many flops is enough? How many hundred million dollar losses on a film can you sustain? Why aren't these writers, directors and studio execs fired after such a loss? Lot of stubborn people in Hollywood. Why can't a movie be made for 20-50 million anymore?"
"Superman is the only movie I'm interested in,the rest I'll wait for streaming services."
Happy Gilmore 2 is NOT coming to theaters.
The naked gun fs
"Eddington!!! While you still can! I honestly thought I wouldn’t like it even tho I love ari aster cuz I’m so sick of politics and covid feels like yesterday. But holy shit. That may be the best satire ever made. Besides maybe the boondocks.

*and it ain’t even like “right wing bad left wing good” or “left wing bad right wing good” it shows idiots and hypocrites on both sides and is maybe the most evil, hilarious, cynical but accurate depictions of the United States ever made.*"
I'll check out Tron because I liked Tron Legacy. I will probably watch Fantastic Four to see what this version has going for it. I'm not convinced I will see any of the others.
"Literally none of them, it’s a TERRIBLE year for movies. Nothing has been particularly good so far and the rest of the slate is uninspired and dull."
"Literally none. Interested in Tron:Ares just for the design alone. Naked Gun… I am strangely and cautiously optimistic, but I can easily wait for it to hit streaming services."
"I can honestly say, none. Movies are just AI slop factories now with the same actors and directors. Franchises that are long past their expiration or reboots etc. Movies lost their magic."
"Jurassic World, HG2 on Netflix, Tron and/or Anaconda if reviews are good. Superman looks awful, Gunn trying too hard."
NONE!!!
"Same tbh! Been kind of a shallow year for movies for me, I'm looking forward to Zootopia 2 tho"
"That's not pretentiousness, it's honesty. None of those movies are worth watching for free. It's like Hollywood isn't even trying anymore. 😤"
"It's on Netflix this coming week,I forgot the exact date."
Same here
"But we are fortunate in regards to there being so many movies out there, even available freely, which we have access to. There's a lot of movies that were made even during the year that I was born, that I haven't seen, and quite a few look very interesting to me. 

If you need a list of good movies, I try to keep track of the good ones....at least ones that appeal to me. These days, there's a hard agenda behind many films, and a lot of people are aware of it, and plenty of people are sick of it."
"Indeed. This post is a month old. Back when I looked up the information on Google, it gave me the list of movies. But yes you are correct, it is not going to be released in theaters according to what it says online."
Eddington?
"What do you mean? There’s so much diversity in the list:

- Reboot of an 80s movie

- Sequel of a 90s movie

- Sequel of a 90s movie

- Prequel of a 21 year old movie (Passion of the Christ, I assume)

- Sequel of an 80s movie

- Sequel of a 90s movie

- Sequel of an 18 year old movie

- Reboot of a super hero franchise

- Reboot of a 40s movie (I assume)

- Reboot of a super hero franchise

What’s not to love?"
"Yeah, lots of sequels and IP. I’m sure there’s audiences for that, but it’s been dry for me personally. Sinners is the only standout for me, although FD Bloodlines was a guilty pleasure too."
And Marshall is in it
"If I have to watch another film with Pedro Pascal in it I might blow my fucking brains out, so no.

Storytelling is in the toilet. Casting seems to be a lost art. We’ve been lucky to get 1 good movie a year for almost a decade now. It’s exhausting."
"Honestly, someone who gets it is refreshing.
How are people so openly accepting of mediocrity. It’s fucking crazy. It rewards lazy filmmaking. Cinema is just waiting for its final death knell - even longstanding and beloved franchises seem to have lost favour.

Mission impossible - didn’t enjoy DR Part 1, not bothered about 2 and have heard that it’s disappointing
Bond - ruined in NTTD and I’m honestly over any sequels. I’ve longed for it but I also don’t trust Amazon after Rings of Power
MCU - is just the worst now. To the point it’s ruined its own legacy
Jurassic Park is TIRED, it was tired by JP 3.
DC - is a fucking mess. I have no interest in watch variations of Guardians of the Galaxy now Gunn is in charge. They ruined the only interesting films they had in Joker & The Batman through delays and crappy sequels.
Have I missed anything?
It’s all SO boring. Even inventive ideas, unique concepts are wasted."
I'll probably pirate them all and not bother watching any of them.
"LOVED sinners, and honestly FD bloodlines was actually pretty good. Like I wish I could’ve seen it in theaters"
I was having a similar conversation with a friend after watching 28 years later. It feels that writers are using AI or something. It was the same with sinners in that everyone goes nuts and praises films that are just mediocre really. I feel that writers cant tell a good story anymore.
"I am sick and tired of Pedro Pascal but it's just false that ""no good movies come out anymore.""  Just in the past couple of months we've had Friendship, The Surfer, Ballad of Wallis Island, Superboys of Malegaon, and Black Bag. "
"It seems like A.I. could do all parts of the film... from the writing, making the actors, to writing original music....etc...? correct?"
"I didn’t say no good movies come out anymore. I said we’re lucky to get 1 good movie a year. I wouldn’t consider 2 movies below a 7/10 movie a “good” movie. As for the other 3? They look insufferable.

You’re mistaking passable or serviceable with GOOD. If you go back a decade and beyond the number of highly regarded films coming out was ridiculous."
">The less human the monster looks, the better

The Thing.


Also,  you don't see it for awhile but The Ritual has one of my favorite monster reveals."
"""Nope"" has the most terrifying monster I can think of. It won't terrify everyone, but that mf gives me massive anxiety. "
"The Thing, 1982. Probably the best creature flick ever created."
The one in The Ritual is awesome.
The Bear in Annihilation
No movie monster has scared me more than the dudes from The Descent - but they might be more humanoid than you're looking for. 
The relic
I always thought Alien was among the scariest because it takes so long for the audience so see what the thing actually looks like. You just know there's some horrible thing consuming the members of the ship.
The Substance 
The monster in the Smile movies.
The Fly
Pumpkinhead
"Man the creature from The Babadook creeped me out like no other, don't think it's seen very much in the movie, so how much mileage you'll get if you're looking for creature features, but holy moley"
The trolls in Earnest Scared Stupid are scary as hell.
[The Blob (1988) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq0our4mceQ)\- The original in '59 scared me as a child; and the '88 remake was a blast!
The hill has eyes 1 and 2 I like it
20 million miles to Earth - 1957
Go for “The Host” (2006) - it’s pretty sweet; Out of South Korea. Thank me later!
Splinter
The Krytes from critters are nasty little devils
I loved the monsters in day after tomorrow. Their movement was so cool.
"Its probably because I saw it as a kid, but The Ones We Do Not Speak of in The Village. Always found their design to be freaky"
"The original Rec in spanish had a pretty horrific, proper scary monster. I thought the new Nosferatu was also pretty horrible and gross but not so scary.  
When it came out the girl in The Ring scared the shit out of me but it’s been such a long time it kinda lost its impact. But I think at the time the way it was edited to give her this unnatural jerky movement was quite novel."
One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. I DARE YOU to name a worse monster… okay Kathy Bates a close second
Superman 2025.
Not really a horror movie but the Golgathan in Dogma is pretty disturbing.
"Monsters (2010), was so real - people in AZ were afraid to walk out of the treatre"
Monsters 2010 was a good watch
"Such a fun movie! Monster isn't scary looking, but it is indeed very scary, nope sums it up nicely"
The first encounter if you pause it looks like he's posing for the picture
They were soooo gross!!!
"The monster, Ymir, was one of Ray Harryhausen's earliest creations."
"Luv all of Ray's work! 

The monsters in Jason and the Argonauts 1963 were pretty scary, too."
"Wes Anderson's doing a June movie, PT Anderson has a $145M budget, and Dwayne Johnson is going for a nomination. What a year"
The trailer for Drop has got to be one of the biggest offenders of showing the entire movie in the trailer in a while.
"Are they remaking The War of the Roses?


Not sure how I feel about that."
So much Sydney Sweeney on screen. I can’t believe there are 2 the same weekend. Everyone will be at Eden for obvious reasons.
Was Atlantis unshelved?
Is A24 really not giving Friendship a wide release? 
The Ballad of Wallis Island comes out at my theater next week. Very excited for that
Overwhelmingly sequels or remakes for most of the movies this year. How boring.
"PTA’s One Battle After Another in September

Benny Safdie’s The Smashing Machine and Derek Cianfrance’s Roofman in October

Edgar Wright’s Running Man and another Dan Trachtenberg Predator movie in November. Also Rian Johnson’s Wake Up Dead Man will likely release on Netflix the same month. 


We eating good this fall. 

Just need A24 to give Ari Aster’s Eddington a release date and we’re golden"
"So much horror.  Ugh.

I miss rom coms and outright comedies.  Very few in this list."
The Neighborhood Watch erasure is breaking my heart. 
A Naked Gun Remake WHAT? WHY!!
"> Avatar: Fire and Ash

I completely forgot about that one. The previous one was thought to be a second coming and now we are like ""meh, whatever"".

> Now You See Me, Now You Don’t

I did not expect to have a sequel there. The original one was fun so maybe this one will too.

> Mortal Kombat 2

The first one was a wasted potential. At least this one has Karl Urban so there is one reason to see it.

> Tron: Ares

I forgot that we will actually get a new Tron movie. And Gillian Anderson is there! Yeah

> The War of the Roses

I think it is time to rewatch the original. Movies with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were always a blast. We don't really have a duo like that nowadays.

The cast in this new one is great, I hope this one will be fun!~

> One Battle Too Many

The combination of cast and director is very promising. Looking forward to that one.

> Nobody 2

The first one was a gem. Fingers crossed for this one too.

> 28 Years Later

Another sequel where my fingers are crossed

---

There are like 5-8 others that I'm very interested to see. Even though most of the stuff is either a sequel or a remake - I'm still surprised how many things I am interested in."
When is Coyote vs ACME getting released? That's all I'm really interested until Star Wars.
Thank you so much!
I see what I consider a lot of movies in theaters. For 2025 I'm sitting at 12 so far. I think that trailer has played in every single movie I've gone to. I'll go and see just about anything but seeing that trailer so many times now has kinda turned me off to it.
"Every time I see that title, I get disappointed that it's not about the real war. 😞"
On IMDB it’s simple called The Roses. It’s basically flipped by it’s a remake. This time the husband has issues instead of the wife feeling overlooked.
"> Everyone will be at Eden for obvious reasons

what are the reasons?"
"Maybe they are. It just hasn't been scheduled, as of yet."
"I'm happy for you just as I'm happy for those who are going to be fortunate enough to be able to watch Cronenberg's ""The Shrouds"" in a real theater. But they are both receiving a ""limited"" release, not a ""wide"" one."
"This slate looks depressing AF. Weekends without new movies?! Crazy. 

I hope we get a lot of re-releases of classic movies."
"Mid budget comedies just don't make money. Horror movies tend to have low budgets, and thanks to a dedicated audience, will often make their money back in the first week."
It’s such a shame how romcoms have been relegated to being almost entirely zero-effort zero-budget Hallmark-style movies on streaming.
"When/if it's ever scheduled, it will be added, I assure you."
"I don't get it either. Just re-release the original. It still holds up (mostly) and it's still uproariously funny (mainly). 

But along with cocaine, easy, no effort money is a hell of a drug to/for studio executives."
"Not yet scheduled. Should it (ever) be (this year), I'll add it to the listing tout de suite."
Agreed and I feel like I’ve already seen it now
That’s game of thrones right isn’t it kinda based on the war of the roses
They are reportedly doing a 3-some.
Sydney Sweeny and Ana De Armas are very famous for their...plots.
"I can't believe that it has changed that much since 2015.

[https://www.jonathanwstokes.com/blog/2015/04/18/are-romantic-comedies-profitable](https://www.jonathanwstokes.com/blog/2015/04/18/are-romantic-comedies-profitable)

I personally think it is just because horror is part of the Zeitgeist right now - a reflection of what is going on in the real world."
"Agreed.  I had hopes that Crazy Rich Asians would bring on a new wave.  Plus that one had SEQUELS already written! 

There are a couple of actresses that I think would be PERFECT with the right script and director.  Ayo Edebiri (she is wickedly funny on the red carpet - does not miss a beat) and Nicola Coughlan.  Two Irish Princesses!  (IYKYK)"
Agreed!!!
"If you want the Wars of the Roses, your play is to watch: *The Hollow Crown: Henry VI, The White Queen* and *The Hollow Crown: Richard III*."
"There are some superficial similarities, but not really."
"HOLY SHIT!!!

i'll just HAVE to go out of my way and pay to see a movie to watch with other strangers to see some actors have a fake 3-some.

so stoked!!!!!!!!"
"Just watched Eden. There is an implied 3-some between Ana de Armas and two guys, but that’s it. Nothing to get excited about"
"i mean, are people really going out of their way and paying to see a movie just to see pretty people on a screen? is that where we're at nowadays?

if so, those people need to reevaluate their life a bit. and i'll also let them in on this little secret thing call ""the internet"" if they really need to scratch that itch of seeing beautiful people on a screen. and it's free!"
In a few more years movies will have real sex.
">  is that where we're at nowadays?

most movies are just ""pretty people on the screen"""
"You mean like...always? Movies have always been ""attractive people on a screen"" because yes, people like looking at attractive people do things. It's not new."
"That's weird, man

And like I said, you can watch attractive people do things on TV or the internet for free. No need to go out of your way to go to the movies and pay all that money for that"
Kpop Demon Hunters obvi
Eddington was low key best of the summer IMO
Superman Vs F4 vs Jurassic Slop Afterbirth......if you don't count K-Pop Demon Hunters I'll say F1
"In terms of cultural conversation, I’m feeling like it’s Superman."
F1
"40 Acres, Sorry, Baby, 28 Years Later, Friendship, and Bring Her Back were all far better viewing."
F1
"Superman was cool, it's changing and I can understand that some people don't support the DA.
Jurassic world is bland.... Nothing original, nothing remarkable. Big disappointment for me 
Fantastic four, I expected nothing with all the previous marvels but very good surprise."
[deleted]
"We're only 2/3 of the way through summer. 

I mean, Fantastic Four has only been out for a week. 

If we are looking at the box office, you surprisingly didn't even mention the #1 movie, Lilo & Stitch, which out performed #2, Jurassic World: Rebirth  by almost 40%, $420m to $307m. 

I don't know that there was any sort of clear winner. No one movie seemed to really stand out above the rest. I probably heard more people talking about Sinners than any other movie."
"Jurassic World was dogshit as expected. Fantastic Four was boring and disappointing. F1 was great just as I expected. But Superman was absolutely amazing, exceeding my expectations"
Superman was the best of the ones you named. F1 was an incredible theater experience. F4 was alright and Jurassic Park sucked in every way imaginable. As far as the “film of 2025” we got a long way to go before that gets decided. But there have been some bangers this year for sure
"Lilo & Stitch. Was greenlit as a Disney+ streaming exclusive, Disney changed their mind, gave it a theatrical release, and it grossed 1 billion dollars. If that's not a success story, I don't know what is."
That was a really nice surprise. Sony Animation has been on a sick run lately
"I havnt seen that yet, but I cant wait to. I hear you either love it or hate it."
"Yeah, I agree. Despite Jurassic World making so much at the box office, I see no one talking about it."
"Yeah defs Superman , the “hope core” aspect of it went crazy viral. 

The only F4 memes I see are the Pedro Pascal anxiety molesting memes.

I would go F1 as a close second."
That's fair. All those aren't really my taste. I enjoy lighter stuff. But glad you enjoyed them!
"Pretty sure it is, box office wise."
"I dunno, its made the most of the summer so far. [Worldwide](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/releasegroup/gr4002763269/?ref_=bo_rl_su) [$727,392,476](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/releasegroup/gr4002763269/?ref_=bo_rl_su). I'm sure the universal executives see it as a winner lol"
"Best movie so far: Sinners

Best Box-Office: Lilo and Stitch

Movie Most Likely to Make it's owners 10 billion dollars over the next 10 years: Kpop Demon Hunters"
"That's true, I totally forgot about Lilo and Stitch! I didn't see that one ye,t but I'm sure it's fun."
I don't want to sit through F4 but I'm feeling the same way about the other 3.
"You may not like F4, but it is not boring, lol. It’s less than 2 hours ling and moves at a brisk speed."
I did care about the couple having their first child in F4.  It was human and relatable.  Didn’t care too much about anybody in Superman.  None of the characters felt like actual human beings.
"Yeah, I obviously thought it was awesome, it's set during the pandemic so I think that turns a lot of people off but the pandemic is not the main plot. I think if you like other Ari Aster movies, you'll dig it. 

That said, I haven't seen F4 yet... Looks cool."
[deleted]
"Yeah, Netflix is already planning all sorts of spin-offs and sequels. We'll see if the quality can last."
The characters are boring
?
"Regardless, I think its now in that ""Little Girls are Obsesssed with it"" sweet spot where you could turn it into this decades Frozen if you know what you're doing, though this will be new territory for Netflix."
"Did you pay for all those movies with commas and that's why you don't have any? 


Also Naked Gun was hysterical. "
It always amazes me what people think is worthwhile to be posted to a sub with 37 million subscribers. Imagine what would happen if every one of those people posted a list of all their cinema visits.
Amateur was way worse than Flight Risk
"He subscribed to A-Commas, which unfortunately allows only four commas per week."
r/rareinsults 
I had them in a list but jumbled them all together. It was pretty dry for me. Like i said i loved the original 3 naked guns.
Do you need a snickers?
Yeah it was pretty low for me also even seeing it a 2nd time on streaming. Black bag was ok i was expecting more from the film.
Inflation on commas
Hey you got a deal on commas! 
"Depends, are you charging theater prices for it?"
"I thought Black Bag was really polished, had a great cast and crisp direction, but also wound up not enjoying it as much as I expected"
You could sign up for Commas Unlimited. The only problem is the upcharge for premium commas.
I went to commas r us and they made me an offer I couldn’t refuse.
For you itll be 20 bucks 🤪🤪
I figured it was going to be more a cat and mouse situation between fassbender and blanchet
"Yea I’m living word to word, can’t make that work"
How about 20 commas. 
"We don’t accept that for payment , come back when you have the proper currency."
