"One of the things I loved most about Earth 828 was the initial plan to defeat Galactus. It was going to take EVERYONE. Everyone on the planet, every country working together regardless of their differences to build the portal bridges to save Earth. It was honestly a little jarring to me at first. I was like ""damn, this is what it looks like for every country on the planet to work together for a common good."" Just shows in an idealized world if everyone can just truly cooperate together, we could accomplish some unthinkable feats. Needed that bit of optimism in our torn and divided Earth right now",One things loved most Earth initial plan defeat Galactus going take EVERYONE Everyone planet every country working together regardless differences build portal bridges save Earth honestly little jarring first like damn looks like every country planet work together common good Just shows idealized world everyone can just truly cooperate together could accomplish some unthinkable feats Needed bit optimism torn divided Earth right now

"I really loved this. The whole sequence in space with Sue giving birth while they try to escape Silver Surfer was awesome. 

I really loved the cast. Vanessa Kirby and Joseph Quinn in particular really shined. Even though I love Pedro Pascal, i wasn’t sure about him as Reed when he was cast. That said, he nailed it. Really thought he did a great job. Ebon Moss Bachrach was great too but I felt like Thing was weirdly underutilized. It felt like his scenes got cut (there had to have been more with Natasha Lyonne, right?)

I could’ve used more Paul Walter Hauser lol he was great in every scene.

"Enjoyed the retro-futuristic setting of the movie a lot. The cast did an amazing job, Vanessa as Sue was for sure the highlight of movie and it was amazing to see her motherhood being central theme here. she was the one to knock down Silver Surfer during the chase scene (while being in labour) and also the final fight where she overpowered Galactus. Loved it so much. 

Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm was the MVP for me, I love how they didn’t make him a total man-child in this one. His portrayal was intelligent, smart and figured out the Shalla-Bal’s language on his own (also loved that Sue genuinely believed that her brother was onto something)",Enjoyed retrofuturistic setting movie lot cast amazing job Vanessa Sue sure highlight movie amazing see motherhood central theme one knock Silver Surfer chase scene labour also final fight overpowered Galactus Loved so much Joseph Quinn Johnny Storm MVP love didnt make total manchild one portrayal intelligent smart figured ShallaBals language own also loved Sue genuinely believed brother onto something

I was hoping for more action scenes as a team. The 2005 film had them all fight Dr Doom at the end as a team and we didn't get a scene like that in this movie.

"Was I the only one who had a practically silent audience? Opening night, packed theater, major city, but I felt like almost nobody was laughing or getting excited about almost anything. I felt the tone of the movie fell a little flat but I’m not sure if it actually was or just the lack of audience response made it feel that way. I suspect it was a bit of both. I’m not saying it was a giant comedy, but I laughed far more than my audience seemed to. 

Overall I thought it was okay. I loved the aesthetic and the storyline was interesting/heartfelt, but I found it hard to see the characters beyond Johnny Storm as real people and the tone like I said felt off and almost inhuman in a way. I also liked the subplot of the entire world working together to build the gates to stop Galactus. I did NOT like that they announced to the world that the bad guy asked for their baby and they said no. Why would you TELL PEOPLE THAT?? Are you stupid? Again it contributed to their almost inhuman vibe, in that no person would actually act that way. And then walking outside with said baby, among a crowd of people who want you to sacrifice him, to give your heartfelt speech? It’s not like I need the entire plot of a superhero movie to be 100% realistic, I don’t care about superpowers or non scientific space travel or aliens on surfboards or whatever, but at least make your humans act like humans!!",only one practically silent audience Opening night packed theater major city felt like almost nobody laughing getting excited almost anything felt tone movie fell little flat Im not sure actually just lack audience response made feel way suspect bit Im not saying giant comedy laughed far more than audience seemed Overall thought okay loved aesthetic storyline interestingheartfelt found hard see characters beyond Johnny Storm real people tone like said felt almost inhuman way also liked subplot entire world working together build gates stop Galactus NOT like announced world bad guy asked baby said no would TELL PEOPLE stupid contributed almost inhuman vibe no person would actually act way walking outside said baby among crowd people want sacrifice give heartfelt speech not like need entire plot superhero movie realistic dont care superpowers non scientific space travel aliens surfboards whatever least make humans act like humans

"I can't name a single thing that's wrong with the direction, casting, acting, visuals, or story but this just did not resonate with me. My son also struggled to articulate how he felt about it but settled on ""underwhelmed"" and after rewatching the first movie, extremely disappointed in how Reed's powers are portrayed.

There's a scene in the first *Fantastic Four* where Ben's ex-fiance sees him cheered on as a hero but leaves her engagement ring on the ground anyway and Ben, being ""The Thing,"" can't pick it up himself so Reed walks up and hands it to him promising to do his best to make things right for him.

Nothing in this movie makes me feel for the characters the way that did.

"The way we all expected galactus to win setting up the space ship entering the MCU from the end of thunderbolts. Instead, it’ll likely be doom taking Franklin which prompts them to chase him down.

"The FF's plan to defeat Galactus is to put their baby in a car seat and place it in the middle of a big target zone in the middle of Times Square and Galactus just gets out of his chair and walks right toward it. It looks and feels ridiculous.

Then they have Kirby shove her hands out a few times at the big CGI dude until they win.

The third act of this movie was terrible and the script was very bad.  There was very little tension, suspense, or fun. I liked all the actors but they never said or did anything to make me like the characters in the context of the film and I love these characters otherwise.",FFs plan defeat Galactus put baby car seat place middle big target zone middle Times Square Galactus just gets chair walks right toward looks feels ridiculous Kirby shove hands few times big CGI dude win third act movie terrible script very bad very little tension suspense fun liked actors never said anything make like characters context film love characters otherwise

"The first act of this movie was really fun. But once they returned from meeting Galactus the plot lost all momentum and the stakes really didn’t seem that high. And the final fight was super disappointing. Neither a cool/fun fight nor an interesting plan to watch unfold.

This is like their 5th project that “tries to be different” but ends up as just another formulaic MCU movie. With hints and teases of interesting ideas, but ones they’re too afraid to explore or commit to by the end.

I’m sticking with DC for my superhero content from now on.

"Pleasant watch but didn't really wow me like I was hoping.
Still a very charming cast and family dynamic which helped ease me into the film. Really dug the retro futuristic 60s style of the film and such a fantastic score from Michael Giacchino. It's easily the highlight of the film.

Sadly felt they underused Ralph Ineson as Galactus. His voice is so perfect, so it was kinda a shame he didn't really get a moment to shine. Loved his ""clever bugs"" line though haha.
Also lol at the way Richard said ""moleman"" such unexpected venom haha.

Questionable Baby cgi aside haha, there was some pretty stunning cgi in this. The whole black hole escape sequence was breathtaking.

Probably a good jumping back on point for those who have fallen off the MCU train as it's very much self contained and no prior homework is needed to watch it heh.
Enjoyable but not fantastic. Still looking forward to seeing this cast interact with the rest of the MCU.

The Incredible's still reign supreme as tbe best Fantastic Four film haha",Pleasant watch didnt really wow like hoping Still very charming cast family dynamic helped ease film Really dug retro futuristic s style film such fantastic score Michael Giacchino easily highlight film Sadly felt underused Ralph Ineson Galactus voice so perfect so kinda shame didnt really get moment shine Loved clever bugs line though haha Also lol way Richard said moleman such unexpected venom haha Questionable Baby cgi aside haha some pretty stunning cgi whole black hole escape sequence breathtaking Probably good jumping back point fallen MCU train very much self contained no prior homework needed watch heh Enjoyable not fantastic Still looking forward seeing cast interact rest MCU Incredibles still reign supreme tbe best Fantastic Four film haha

"Galactus could have had it all, but he forgot about one thing... the power of Motherhood.

But seriously, though. It's a fantastic film. The birth of Franklin Richards was a moment ripped from the panels of a comic. I really felt like I was watching a pivotal moment in the MCU.

Between this and Superman, it's an awesome time to be a comic book movie fan. I am so glad we are getting films that lean into the fantastical aspects of comic books instead of trying to be dark, gritty, and realistic.

The pacing was atrocious, the character development was non existent, the stakes felt so small even though they were going up against one of Marvel’s most powerful villains, and that end fight literally was just “push the big guy into the hole”. Maybe the F4 are just heroes that it’s hard to make a compelling big screen adaptation to or something, idk…",someone big fan CBMs shockingly hated movie Like truly thought awful pacing atrocious character development non existent stakes felt so small even though going one Marvels most powerful villains end fight literally just push big guy hole Maybe F just heroes hard make compelling big screen adaptation something idk
"I was just so bored. If you're going to skip over the origin story then I need a more complicated plot. They're correct in that we already know their powers and relationships. So give me more. Assume I know things and can follow it. But this movie could have been an email. The plot point they have a baby is the only thing you need to know going into Avengers. Because I got nothing from any of them personality wise. At least with an origin story I could've seen the conflict of them adjusting to their new bodies.


I think I put Brave New World ahead of this. At least there I was interested in seeing what's going on in the main world when I haven't gotten that in a while. I didn't give a damn about this world. The population is so universally happy, then so annoyed, then back to happy again. Good grief. 

Thing was hardly given anything to do. The other 3 kind of given equal billing? I think they should have elevated one of them above the others and give them a clear growth arc. Show flashbacks for the one picked. Like Guardians 1 is more from Peters perspective. The others get more shine as more movies come out. Thunderbolts is a team movie too but Yelena is clearly the lead. It helps give focus. Even look at Eternals. Double the characters as F4 but yet Sersi takes lead and has an arc. Also a ton of internal conflict in the team. Zero of that here. I only put Thor 4 and Ant-Man 3 behind this movie for post Endgame movies. It's maybe tied with Marvels for 3rd worst. Thunderbolts was so much better than this movie. Had significantly better humor AND heart.",just so bored youre going skip origin story need more complicated plot Theyre correct already know powers relationships So give more Assume know things can follow movie could email plot point baby only thing need know going Avengers got nothing personality wise least origin story couldve seen conflict adjusting new bodies think put Brave New World ahead least interested seeing whats going main world havent gotten didnt give damn world population so universally happy so annoyed back happy Good grief Thing hardly given anything other kind given equal billing think should elevated one others give clear growth arc Show flashbacks one picked Like Guardians more Peters perspective others get more shine more movies come Thunderbolts team movie too Yelena clearly lead helps give focus Even look Eternals Double characters F yet Sersi takes lead arc Also ton internal conflict team Zero only put Thor AntMan behind movie post Endgame movies maybe tied Marvels rd worst Thunderbolts so much better than movie significantly better humor heart
"That movie was boring as shit to be completely honest. Galactus aesthetically was awesome but felt like he was in the movie for 5 minutes.

I feel like I watched a different movie than everyone else. 1st 2 acts were boring. Terrible use of Julia Garner’s talents. Dr. Reed doesn’t stretch for 98% of the movie. I actually couldn’t believe during the baby switcheroo scene that Reed literally runs out there like a normal dude. Dude you have stretchy arms!!,feel like watched different movie than everyone else st acts boring Terrible use Julia Garners talents Dr Reed doesnt stretch movie actually couldnt believe baby switcheroo scene Reed literally runs like normal dude Dude stretchy arms
"The more I think about this movie the more annoyed I am by both the way it was made and the fact that people are so accepting of its dullness.

From a drama perspective:

The Fantastic Four do an objectively selfish thing that potentially dooms the entire world, but nobody really talk about it for a second. Sue gets upset and Reed apologizes for even thinking about giving up the baby. Even the angry, fearful crowd is placated by a nice speech. Nobody for a second grapples with their decision, they just go “of course we’re not giving up the baby!” and then they move on, even though that would’ve been a really interesting thing to see well written characters do.

From an action perspective:

The 10 second clip of Reed fighting a monkey in the opening montage is the most interesting thing he does with his powers the whole movie. 

There are a grand total of two action scenes in the whole movie, one of which is pretty great but not very superhero-y because they’re in a spaceship most of the time, the second of which is very short and anticlimactic because it’s against an all powerful ancient god who’s largely unaffected by their powers, until the very end when Sue tries really hard and then the all powerful ancient god tips over backwards and can’t stop himself from being shoved in a portal.

The Fantastic Four deserves better than this. Galactus deserves better than this.

It was decent. The style and production was top notch but just felt very 'safe' for a Marvel movie.

"Overall, I enjoyed it but it doesn't have the rewatchability factor that Superman has or even Thunderbolts which I really loved. It drags a lot in parts, at 2 hours it felt longer than Superman or Thunderbolts.

"I’d like to preface that I haven’t read the comics and I’m not a huge marvel fan (I used to be but got burned out). I have seen almost every MCU movie up until Thunderbolts. 

However, as a layperson, I was disappointed by this film. The set was cool and I liked the 60s retro aesthetic, but the plot itself fell flat for me. 

Like, I wasn’t a fan of how Reed just blurted out in a press conference that they were given the choice of giving up Franklin or condemning Earth’s inhabitants to death. It felt a little too convenient. 

Also, there was kind of an undercurrent of pro-family pro life, but I feel like Storm and Grimm fell by the wayside in terms of their relationships with Sue and Reed. I guess I wasn’t sold on their chemistry as a group or as a “fantastic family”. 

I felt like there was this emphasis on scanning the baby for abnormalities (but choosing to have Franklin in spite of their worry), and refusing to give up Franklin to save millions of lives. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I’m not a parent and it’s hard to imagine ever sacrificing my kid but I just expected a more convincing speech from Sue. I was surprised at how quick the tide of public support turned in their favor, but maybe I needed to suspend my belief some more.

That stuck with me. Even protecting your newborn from being kidnapped by aliens…it’s a strange thing for any of the FF to say.  And what a world we they live? Where the world as a a whole concedes they aren’t going to sacrifice a child to save the planet.  Usually I would expect more of a Stephen King “sacrifice the boy” type of mob.  The 828 is just better than us.  I liked the movie but wasn’t blown away…although most of the comments here make me want to watch the movie again.  It’s tough because it feels like the first 10 minutes are exposition to catch you up on their first four years.,stuck Even protecting newborn kidnapped aliensits strange thing FF say world live world whole concedes arent going sacrifice child save planet Usually would expect more Stephen King sacrifice boy type mob just better than us liked movie wasnt blown awayalthough most comments make want watch movie tough feels like first minutes exposition catch first four years

He's not very deft at dealing with things at an abstract perspective, and so when the question was forced on him he couldn't construct an abstract answer that could satisfy the crowd.

2.) why did Reed *immediately* spill the beans at a press conference? Take a day. Say “we’re not sure if you’re safe, we need some time to think and plan. We’ll get back to you soon”

3.) people are suddenly fine with the “baby” side in the previously mentioned dilemma when Sue has a heart-to-heart with a few hundred people in New York? I’d assume 99% of people would be like “sure I get it that’s your kid and family is important, but like it’s him or billions of us.”

"They made a very clear distinction between the other ""intelligent"" front men and Reed Richards, which was great.

Tony Stark is highly intelligent, an engineer, a salesman. He is boasting with confidence and just does things. 

Dr. Strange is - even when humbled - still arrogant. He mostly trusts his own choice and ideas and acts on it. He feels superior to most others.

Reed Richards is kinda a basement nerd. He is probably even more intelligent like the others, but especially thinking about the consequences of his potential actions, which makes him hesitate a lot. He doesnt boast of confidence. It makes him vulnerable and relatable. 

Its really beautifully designed and makes that family dependent on each other, while still each one of them is competent and powerful on its own. 

Comparing this Reed Richards to the MoM-Reed, the differences are obvious: MoM-Reed was intelligent, but overall confident, spilling the beans about the powers of his companions and making them vulnerable for an opponent he highly underestimated.

"> and is a womanizer. 

I also liked the way they handled this aspect of his character. The Chris Evans iteration is the type to sleep with basically any woman that moves. But comic Johnny is really more of a serial monogamist. He tends to bounce from relationship to relationship and is very often the one getting dumped, rather than just going out and sleeping with a new supermodel every night. That's not a recent innovation either but has been a thing going back to the 60s, when he was dating Doris, gets dumped, and immediately rebounds by getting into a relationship with Crystal. 

Just from the way that they handled his interest in the Surfer, I could totally buy that this version of Johnny is the same.",womanizer also liked way handled aspect character Chris Evans iteration type sleep basically woman moves comic Johnny really more serial monogamist tends bounce relationship relationship very often one getting dumped rather than just going sleeping new supermodel every night Thats not recent innovation either thing going back s dating Doris gets dumped immediately rebounds getting relationship Crystal Just way handled interest Surfer could totally buy version Johnny same

"Yup this version of Reed seemed ""nerfed"" so to say, from what we have seen the character do in previous films.

Ioan Gruffudd’s  Reed was impressively stretchy, in Fantastic Four 2 there’s that scene where he wraps his entire body, including all his limbs around that massive Ferris wheel in London to stop it from collapsing. Which really showed the full extent of how flexible and powerful his stretching ability could be.

However Pascal’s version feels noticeably toned down. Galactus whips him around like a rubber band and stretches him *just a bit* (comparatively to what we saw Gruffudd do), and its noticeable how it seriously affects him, since Reed looks very visibly hurt and his suit starts tearing itself apart. He also doesn’t do any of the wild morphing or shape-shifting stuff you might expect from Reed, his powers instead seem limited to just casually stretching his limbs and torso a bit?

You kind of get the impression that Pascal’s Reed isn’t able to stretch himself nearly as far or pull off the same level of crazy feats that you'd expect from that powerset. It feels more like his main ""superpower"" in this portrayal is his intelligence, rather than his elasticity. That aspect of the character was very well realized in this movie I felt, as the inventions you see in this alternate universe (flying cars, wormhole technology, etc.) are all heavily implied to have been induced/driven by Mr. Fantastic's mere presence and his status as the Smartest Man Alive. He's clearly THE Tony Stark figure in this universe.

Not a criticism just an interesting difference in powerscaling that I noticed.",Yup version Reed seemed nerfed so say seen character previous films Ioan Gruffudds Reed impressively stretchy Fantastic Four theres scene wraps entire body including limbs around massive Ferris wheel London stop collapsing really showed full extent flexible powerful stretching ability could However Pascals version feels noticeably toned Galactus whips around like rubber band stretches just bit comparatively saw Gruffudd noticeable seriously affects since Reed looks very visibly hurt suit starts tearing apart also doesnt wild morphing shapeshifting stuff might expect Reed powers instead seem limited just casually stretching limbs torso bit kind get impression Pascals Reed isnt able stretch nearly far pull same level crazy feats youd expect powerset feels more like main superpower portrayal intelligence rather than elasticity aspect character very well realized movie felt inventions see alternate universe flying cars wormhole technology etc heavily implied induceddriven Mr Fantastics mere presence status Smartest Man Alive Hes clearly Tony Stark figure universe Not criticism just interesting difference powerscaling noticed

"It really seems like they were too scared to do something really ambitious with his powers. Like they gave up on anything crazy before even storyboarding the film.

"I don't envy the writers for these films. They have to still craft the right emotional stakes, while also dealing with audiences who know very well that these characters can't ever die.

Plus, Marvel has spent a good decade training people to expect comedy to deflate a tense moment like that. Instead, the scene was played completely straight, and I think it caused some audience members to be like, ""Come on. Who you trying to fool?""

I think the problem with that kind of thinking is that it basically makes it hard for those folks to get invested in any story Marvel tells. 

I personally try to just let the movie wash over me. I feel like some folks try so hard to outsmart the film they're watching, and it doesn't do them any favors as moviegoers.

"Loved it for what it was; a good movie.  
Nothing mind-blowing, but was very enjoyable and had some great comedy moments, as well as emotional ones. The overall theme of ""the best way to deal with trauma/depression is to not do it alone"" was very moving. Surprisingly teared up during some parts, wasn't expecting that sort of heavy topic/message to be portrayed so seriously and even be the focus of the movie, sold beautifully by the cast (especially Pugh and Pullman). 

My only gripes:  
Wish we could've gotten more backstory for Ghost, with some scenes involving her ""void"" moments.  
I still feel the same about her as I did at the end of Ant-Man 2; don't really know her or care much about her when I feel like I should. Especially so after establishing her ""refusing to leave anyone behind"" personality, implying she does care deep down and that there's many more layers to her.

(Less of an issue with the movie and more just a personal desire)  
Sentry/Void didn't get to use his signature move of ripping someone in half.  
After seeing what they did with Taskmaster, I feel like they could've used her as the sacrificial lamb for it. Seemed like a missed opportunity that would've been a great reference for comic fans.",Loved good movie Nothing mindblowing very enjoyable some great comedy moments well emotional ones overall theme best way deal traumadepression not alone very moving Surprisingly teared some parts wasnt expecting sort heavy topicmessage portrayed so seriously even focus movie sold beautifully cast especially Pugh Pullman only gripes Wish couldve gotten more backstory Ghost some scenes involving void moments still feel same end AntMan dont really know care much feel like should Especially so establishing refusing leave anyone behind personality implying care deep theres many more layers Less issue movie more just personal desire SentryVoid didnt get use signature move ripping someone half seeing Taskmaster feel like couldve used sacrificial lamb Seemed like missed opportunity wouldve great reference comic fans

"I just wish I could watch a movie with a completed and full script. I left feeling unsatisfied, confused, and condescended to. The depiction of mental health issues felt fake and forced, and there was no real solution. No discussion about Robert's healing journey, no therapy, and barely any tears. How can you have a character who is suffering from depression end on laying in a chair, stress and binging eating take out, with their mode of power, Sentry, unable to take form because they have not healed? Additionally,  he loses his memory. Are you serious? 


Leaving these character developments to future films leaves Thunderbolts unfinished, with its only real development being these anti-heroes are now in a team. Yet I barely felt any chemistry between the characters. There was no dialougue between them to invest me in their relationship; solely emotional dialogue. You only get what they need to say in the face of external action -- a falling piece of rubble, fighting against inside Robert's depressive state, an elevator. No humanness at all. These aren't characters. I suspect these are B-class Heroes not because of their status within the universe, but because the writers just didn't write a bunch of characters who they audience would be invested in like in an A-class hero.


If the characters are supposed to be mirrors - that they are larger than life superheroes we as humans do not need to be invested that much in (which makes for a really uninteresting and bad movie from a craft perspective) - then the writers got it wrong too. These characters SUCK! They have no grandeur for which an audience is to get pulled in by their charms. The only real charm is Florence Pugh because her acting kills and she is pretty despite being in a terrible role writing-wise. 


And b4 someone tells me to watch all the previous movies to understand the plot, a good film should stand on the merit of its filmmaking, writing, acting, and cinematographic choices. Anything else is shallow and entertains a viewer with stale candy.


Overall it just felt like it was more for the industry rather than the viewer. It feels as if you have to force yourself to care the Thunderbolts are reformed, and the only people doing that are the ones who've had a prolonged exposure to the media whose understanding of the film is based upon anything but the film, and possibly anything but the many films that come before this. So rating the movie, for them, seems useless, which leaves folks like me who aren't heavily invested in Marvel, from the comics, shows, or older movies, unable to breathe in this cult, and I suspect it leaves others unsatisfied, suffocated, and almost torn too.

Most of this movie so far has been the characters interacting with each other as if they have seen each other's movies, when they should not know anything about each other's secret agent crap, beyond some basic Intel. This is so insanely convoluted and I'm just surprised people fell for it.

"I dont know how I feel about the movie, just watched a few hours ago in IMAX. 

I was disappointed I didn’t but tickets for 3D. Buuuut, I honestly think your don’t miss anything at all. Doesn’t feel like it was shot in 3D if that makes any sense.

Im not the movie ego type and don’t really care for reviews, from any source. Not Rotten Tomatoes, not IMDB. No one. In fact even my closest Marvel fan friends don’t influence me one bit. 
So here’s my take on the movie and I hope you still see it for your own reasons.

I didn’t absolutely love it, but I also didn’t absolutely hate it.

Was it great to see the B team make a movie? Yeah of course…

Was it boring? 
Not at all…

Was it entertaining?
Yeah I’ll give it that… like 8/9 outta 10

Funny? 
yeah somewhat…but felt a little forced..

Was I let down at all or feel like I was wasting my time?
Absolutely not…

Did it have that, go see it more than once or multiple times in the theatre feel?
Not for me at least….

I can’t get a certain number on a 1-10. Like most Marvel movies at least the recent ones, there were some woah/wow moments but for me nothing like Winter Soldier, Avengers, GoG 2, Antman, Black Widow., & Dr Strange. Prolly leaving out a few but you get what I’m sayin..

Maybe be a solid 6, leaning towards a 7…
I could be wrong. 
Maybe bc the fact I kept reading online everywhere that it was a good as Avengers, so I had my hopes up, but to me it was not… not even close…
Avengers kept you hungry, one interaction after another. But let’s not forget, most of the characters had their own solo movies and individual stories and hardships that made each character more rich. 
Like eating at well known and staple restaurants that’s are known for their popular entrees that are talked about and then going to a place where you could order all these different places all on one plate. 
You knew the potential of each character and you were intrigued what they could come together and do…

Thunderbolts didn’t have this. I felt unsatisfied. Maybe it’s the American in me, but I wanted more, I expected more, maybe bc it was hyped so much… but I was left hungry.

So yeah, please don’t take my review personally. Please go watch it for yourselves. I’m just full of shit… I’m a nobody 
Peace",dont know feel movie just watched few hours ago IMAX disappointed didnt tickets D Buuuut honestly think dont miss anything Doesnt feel like shot D makes sense Im not movie ego type dont really care reviews source Not Rotten Tomatoes not IMDB No one fact even closest Marvel fan friends dont influence one bit So heres take movie hope still see own reasons didnt absolutely love also didnt absolutely hate great see B team make movie Yeah course boring Not entertaining Yeah Ill give like outta Funny yeah somewhatbut felt little forced let feel like wasting time Absolutely not go see more than multiple times theatre feel Not least cant get certain number Like most Marvel movies least recent ones some woahwow moments nothing like Winter Soldier Avengers GoG Antman Black Widow Dr Strange Prolly leaving few get Im sayin Maybe solid leaning towards could wrong Maybe bc fact kept reading online everywhere good Avengers so hopes not not even close Avengers kept hungry one interaction another lets not forget most characters own solo movies individual stories hardships made each character more rich Like eating well known staple restaurants thats known popular entrees talked going place could order different places one plate knew potential each character intrigued could come together Thunderbolts didnt felt unsatisfied Maybe American wanted more expected more maybe bc hyped so much left hungry So yeah please dont take review personally Please go watch Im just full shit Im nobody Peace

"I enjoyed it. I like the lack of distracting stupidly overhyped and screen stealing effects. 

The story was good. Bobs ‘bob’ was a bit unnerving. Those eyes 🫥😶‍🌫️. 

My co-audience wasn’t overly keen on it but I suspect they will come round to it. Although we may start to hear the phrase ‘Bobs a nob’ at some point 🤷🏻‍♂️. 

The story was good and if anyone is looking for a big metaphor then your gonna find it here, and it is good. 

This may be a divisive change to marvel movies but they should carry on. 

I suspect they battled with how soon to ‘drop the hammer’ and balance, and arguably they could have done it sooner. But it’s a bit picky to say that tbh. 

But a good story is a good story.",enjoyed like lack distracting stupidly overhyped screen stealing effects story good Bobs bob bit unnerving eyes coaudience wasnt overly keen suspect will come round Although may start hear phrase Bobs nob some point story good anyone looking big metaphor gonna find good may divisive change marvel movies should carry suspect battled soon drop hammer balance arguably could done sooner bit picky say tbh good story good story

"Definitely a new format of story telling from Marvel. I particularly loved it. No more flashy heroes but a bunch of tired washed heroes just trying to survive. Definitely better than previous renditions of other cinematic universes. Even the way they interact is intentionally muddied down (truck conversation scene). It's not trying to out""cool"" any previous iteration but just trying to be itself.

I remember the first time I was introduced to such a slow paced, non action packed story telling and it definitely is a welcome after such hyped movies back to back these past few years.",Definitely new format story telling Marvel particularly loved No more flashy heroes bunch tired washed heroes just trying survive Definitely better than previous renditions other cinematic universes Even way interact intentionally muddied truck conversation scene not trying outcool previous iteration just trying remember first time introduced such slow paced non action packed story telling definitely welcome such hyped movies back back past few years
"I think Thunderbolts* did a great job at portraying mental health struggles. And as someone who’s lost friends to mental health battles and had their own challenges it really touched my heart. 


Yelena is a fan favorite known for being sarcastic, witty, fun, love-able, and goofy. Now, we see her amidst her struggle to cope with finding purpose and dealing with the loss of her family, especially Natasha. Her father even tells her that he can see that she has lost her light. This is especially painful when you know you’re not yourself and you so desperately want to get your spark back but don’t know how. And you start to lose sight of the person you used to be. Yelena touches on this when she tries to remember the last time she felt joy and asked Alexei the last time he was truly happy. 


Also, the aesthetic of the film and Pugh’s acting captured the numb and lonely feeling very well in my opinion. Showing how one kinda just dredges along day by day. 


In the scene with John, although he seems inattentive and apathetic to his crying child, you can see it’s because he is struggling with his own sense of self. Depression often makes you feel disconnected from the things you love and messed with your ability to complete day-to-day tasks. And sometimes when you’re struggling that hard you lash out at those around you. 


Both Yelena and John faced some of their thoughts when Bob touched them in the vault. But neither one spoke up about what they experienced despite the others noticing that something was wrong. They both shake it off and “shove it down”. 


Fast forward, to when Yelena traverse through the “shame” rooms- it shows us that we cannot change our past, we can only move forward. 


Another thing Marvel did right was not villainizing Bob. From the get-go- Bob voices his challenges with lack of self-esteem, depression, etc. Bob was never the villain. Valentina is the main antagonist and she takes advantage of Bob’s lack of self-worth and esteem to convince him to try to hurt people. But Bob has morals and doesn’t want to hurt those around him. 


Through the void, we visually see the “darkness” take a hold. In the scene where Bob is fighting the void- to me this represented self-hatred and self-sabotage. In fighting our own battles, we get ashamed of the parts of us that think bad thoughts and cause us to act out. We also feel a lack of control in ourselves and the situation around us. Bob is saved by people around him actively stopping him from beating himself to death. Not only that- the thunderbolts* don’t abandon him or lock him up. Again, he was never the villain. 

This overarching theme of hopelessness is transformed by friendship and mutual struggle.",think Thunderbolts great job portraying mental health struggles someone whos lost friends mental health battles own challenges really touched heart Yelena fan favorite known sarcastic witty fun loveable goofy Now see amidst struggle cope finding purpose dealing loss family especially Natasha father even tells can see lost light especially painful know youre not so desperately want get spark back dont know start lose sight person used Yelena touches tries remember last time felt joy asked Alexei last time truly happy Also aesthetic film Pughs acting captured numb lonely feeling very well opinion Showing one kinda just dredges along day day scene John although seems inattentive apathetic crying child can see struggling own sense self Depression often makes feel disconnected things love messed ability complete daytoday tasks sometimes youre struggling hard lash around Yelena John faced some thoughts Bob touched vault neither one spoke experienced despite others noticing something wrong shake shove Fast forward Yelena traverse shame rooms shows us cannot change past can only move forward Another thing Marvel right not villainizing Bob getgo Bob voices challenges lack selfesteem depression etc Bob never villain Valentina main antagonist takes advantage Bobs lack selfworth esteem convince try hurt people Bob morals doesnt want hurt around void visually see darkness take hold scene Bob fighting void represented selfhatred selfsabotage fighting own battles get ashamed parts us think bad thoughts cause us act also feel lack control situation around us Bob saved people around actively stopping beating death Not only thunderbolts dont abandon lock never villain overarching theme hopelessness transformed friendship mutual struggle

I really didn't enjoy it. I figured I'd try out these marvel movies, but doesn't seem like there's much heart or soul in it. 

Ultimately the story is so lame and everything is surface level. The ultimate persons arc happens so quick and there's no depth to any of this.

It was the first time since gotg3 I was tempted, hell even excited to go see a mcu film. Everyone will gleem and glow about the themes because it's about depression, loneliness and childhood trauma, but the movie itself is still shit. 

Bucky might as well not be in the movie, red guardian is there just for comic relief again except for one scene, ghost is completely neutered by the enemy forces, walker is just a dick now, thats his whole personality, and I think we all know what happens to task master. 

Sentry just immediately turns into ""I'm a god now"" against valentina for no real justification. It's literally just one line from valentina and then sentry goes into a rant about how amazing he is. This is also at the very end of the movie, like with 15-20 minutes left. 

Valentina is a complete joke of a character. That is all.

"Seen it yesterday. Miscalculated my edibles so I was certainly a bit too forgiving but it was really great. 
It's like James Gunn had a slightly less talented cousin wrote it and the cousin was also a big Megamind and Homelander fan. I usually don't like Pugh but she carries the movie with a lot of heart and she won me again.
My two only complains are there is no color in this film, it could have been a black and white production and the  climax is a let down action-wise. 
The better aspects are overall cinematography, choreography and tone. The tone specially is very well balanced. It has good, complete, human level arcs for the leads and the comic relief works and is not in your face.

I don't feel like they fleshed out the characters enough. It relies on the audience already knowing them from previous movies, which is fine for major characters—but these were mostly minor ones in earlier installments.

But Sam Wilson was not Captain America in 2013 in the comics when he was cast, so that possibility never went into consideration when they hired him. He was cast for Falcon and I think he did good with that.

In his case too, the writing didn't help him cuz they gave him minimal role plot wise post his first appearance and then just had him be Captain America with little to no set up.  Not to mention having Bucky be THE plot for Cap's entire trilogy made Sam get sidelined even more.

The characters felt...near the original counterparts, with a few changes, of course. Astrid unfortunately felt the weakest, in my opinion. She just seemed so bored with everything around her. The flight on Toothless reminded me of that dinner scene with Emma Watson in Beauty and the Beast.

"So I have actually seen it, and while I do believe in general, live action movies have been lackluster, I also believe they can have value, as something similar to variations on a theme.

In this case while the story is largely untouched, there are a few expanded scenes, action and flight scenes are considerably longer and a few character motivations are slightly modified.

It's not perfect by any means and in no way a replacement but I could easily swap between watching any of the two versions of this story. I like the way scenes have more room to breathe and it feels like a wider look into the world, while the animated one is more agile and focused especially on Hiccup and Toothless.

So all in all, I'm just glad it exists, the space live action adaptations should be in is that of a remix not a remake.",So actually seen believe general live action movies lackluster also believe can value something similar variations theme case story largely untouched few expanded scenes action flight scenes considerably longer few character motivations slightly modified not perfect means no way replacement could easily swap watching two versions story like way scenes more room breathe feels like wider look world animated one more agile focused especially Hiccup Toothless So Im just glad exists space live action adaptations should remix not remake

"It's a shame that in remaking this movie they didn't stick closer to the plot of the original books.

In the books Hiccup's hunting dragon Toothless is not a special rare/feared Night Fury but instead a very boring Common or Garden dragon (>!although much later in the book series we learn he is actually something rather special!<).

I suppose the problem is that the books can afford to slowly build out the story whereas the movie needs to deliver spectacle immediately. In the books it doesn't matter that Toothless is mocked by the other vikings but is special to Hiccup, whereas in the movie he has to be shown to be special for the audience to see him as such.

Each book stands alone but also subtly lays down a piece of the groundwork in such a way that the reader's attention isn't drawn to it until everything gets pulled together in the final few books of the series. In each book Hiccup learns an important lesson and/or gains (what turns out to be) a critically important artefact. It's very cleverly written and I have huge respect for Cressida Cowell who must have carefully plotted out the whole 12 book storyline long before sitting down to write the first one.

10/10 recommendation for the books. Better than the movies in every way.

I, like so many of us, know this movie line for line and I was still never bored because there was so much to take in visually and I was just giddy to see real live versions of all these characters and get immersed in their world. I appreciate this movie for what it is and what beautiful piece of art they have created. I for one am hoping they continue making these.

"I just saw the movie with my GF, and it made me remember how I felt when i saw the animated version years ago. It was pure nostalgia on my part. But my GF never saw the animated version, and let me tell you that 
, she casually lets out the phrase ""so beautiful"" so many times while watching. She tries to stop herself from crying when toothless was battling the fire dragon. And she laughs at scenes where toothless acts like a dog and a cat. She is impressed when Hiccup takes advantage of what he learns from toothless about dragons. Needless to say, she enjoyed it enough to be excited for the 2nd movie to be released.

If you compared it to the animated version, it doesnt give new stuff, just some setup scenes here and there for the next movie, (if it ever comes out, hopefully it will) . But when watched for the first time, its a memorable ride to experience.

"Honestly, I’m an adult and wasn’t a massive fan of the original or anything and have never left a movie review before, but saw it last night and was super super surprised at how good it was. Like? What? Why is this the only CGI/animation integrated with Live action I’ve ever seen where it actually looks good? There were only a couple scenes I could clearly tell where one ended and another began because it was that good, and the lighting was affective and atmospheric. The casting as crazily accurate and acting was surprisingly good and natural, so yeah - surprisingly good all round. The costumes were amazing too - didn’t look too artificial or out of place. The original was a bit clearer on their story telling aspect, and I do wish they added smth new (maybe smth from the books? I haven’t read them so idk) because obviously you know what’s going to happen in it anyway.",Honestly Im adult wasnt massive fan original anything never left movie review saw last night super super surprised good Like only CGIanimation integrated Live action Ive ever seen actually looks good only couple scenes could clearly tell one ended another began good lighting affective atmospheric casting crazily accurate acting surprisingly good natural so yeah surprisingly good round costumes amazing too didnt look too artificial place original bit clearer story telling aspect wish added smth new maybe smth books havent read so idk obviously know whats going happen anyway

"Just here to chime in and say that this was the best live adaptation I have ever seen. The casting was somehow perfect? Every single scene was done well and the things that were added only enhanced the story. A testament to how good the original screenplay was, the whole team did incredible. The camera work, cgi, and location scouting were on point! I urge people to go see it if you enjoyed the original before coming to a judgement about it.

"Dear filmmakers and TV show writers... THIS is how you make a live action adaptation. This movie was absolutely perfect. Perfect cast, great acting, great dialogue, amazing CGI, and most of all incredible story. And the best part, they didn't change anything about the story. Why? Because the it's already great.

"I loved it for staying (mostly) true to the story. There were a few things added into the dialogue that didn't feel super necessary, but I'm not going to throw the whole movie away over that. The only thing difficult for me is some of the casting choices. For example the twins, Tuffnut and Ruffnut, were supposed to be so close to looking alike that the ongoing gag was that they are often confused for each other despite one being male; the other female. These two barely looked like siblings to me, much less (nearly) identical twins. I did appreciate them sticking to the dialogue though.. almost word for word.

"For me personally. My problem with the movie wasn't that it replaced the original scene for scene. It's that every scene felt slightly weaker than the original.

The original movie lets the pacing of scenes breath a lot better. The acting is a lot more expressive and playful. This felt like exactly what it is,

An imitation.",personally problem movie wasnt replaced original scene scene every scene felt slightly weaker than original original movie lets pacing scenes breath lot better acting lot more expressive playful felt like exactly imitation

"I've never read the books but I heard they were vastly different from the original HTTYD films. A while ago when they first started filming, or were about to, I saw an article saying that the director wanted to make this live action film closer to the book, and I was actually excited to hear that! Rather than remaking the exact same film but without the great animation and pacing, we would be getting essentially a brand new story that can stand on it's own!

Then I saw the first trailer....

It looked exactly the same as the original animated film. And now it's confirmed it's essentially a pointless copy.

A good remake, regardless of medium, is usually great because of its changes. The Lord of the Rings films make big changes, but they're good ones that make them better movies. Same for Dune 1 and 2.

If you don't make any changes, then you made a cheap copy product, not a piece of art.

Even if the changes were offensive and missed the point, at least Lilo and Stitch TRIED something different and gave people something to talk about and appreciate the original even more because of how bad it was.

Unfortunately though this will make a ton of money because of nostalgia and there are also sadly a lot of people out there that don't like animation purely because it's animated so they'll think this remake is superior",Ive never read books heard vastly different original HTTYD films ago first started filming saw article saying director wanted make live action film closer book actually excited hear Rather than remaking exact same film without great animation pacing would getting essentially brand new story can stand own saw first trailer looked exactly same original animated film now confirmed essentially pointless copy good remake regardless medium usually great changes Lord Rings films make big changes theyre good ones make better movies Same Dune dont make changes made cheap copy product not piece art Even changes offensive missed point least Lilo Stitch TRIED something different gave people something talk appreciate original even more bad Unfortunately though will make ton money nostalgia also sadly lot people dont like animation purely animated so theyll think remake superior
"I loved it. I typically don’t really bother with live action since the past experiences I had were quite meh. But this one managed to make me feel the same as I did in the animated movie years ago. And I think that’s the most important part. Hiccup was great, I like Astrid in it. It’s not necessary sure, but I’m so glad it didn’t turn out to be a slop. I loved how it’s faithful to the original, and the music was PEAKKK. What I didn’t like so much was the twin’s casting, but I can see that they’re going for a different route with the jokes. Instead of “We look nothing alike” despite looking exactly the same, they went for “We look EXACTLY the same” despite looking completely different. I’m not so sure about Gobber tho, he seems more serious in this one. Toothless is AMAZINGG. Stoic was awesome. I also loved the original scene where Astrid bashes Red Death’s teeth to help her dragon, I liked that one better than in the original animation movie.",loved typically dont really bother live action since past experiences quite meh one managed make feel same animated movie years ago think thats most important part Hiccup great like Astrid not necessary sure Im so glad didnt turn slop loved faithful original music PEAKKK didnt like so much twins casting can see theyre going different route jokes Instead look nothing alike despite looking exactly same went look EXACTLY same despite looking completely different Im not so sure Gobber tho seems more serious one Toothless AMAZINGG Stoic awesome also loved original scene Astrid bashes Red Deaths teeth help dragon liked one better than original animation movie

"I know the trend is to criticize Disney remakes, but I at least get the appeal of switching 2D to LA or CGI.  It looks and feels like a different domain.  But when a CGI movie like this still has to heavily rely on CGI it really kills the appeal of remaking it.

I'm fine with these movies being made though.  People obviously want to go watch them otherwise they wouldn't make a profit and wouldn't continue to happen.  

I haven't hated most fo the Disney LA remakes.  I haven't loved many of them but they have mostly been competent movies that feel distinct enough to be different but also seem to appeal to younger generations more than the 2D animation does.",know trend criticize Disney remakes least get appeal switching D LA CGI looks feels like different domain CGI movie like still heavily rely CGI really kills appeal remaking Im fine movies made though People obviously want go watch otherwise wouldnt make profit wouldnt continue happen havent hated most fo Disney LA remakes havent loved many mostly competent movies feel distinct enough different also seem appeal younger generations more than D animation

"I'm a massive fan of the HTTYD franchise. I was cautiously optimistic for this film because Dean directed it, and since I loved even the controversial third film in the original trilogy, I had faith in him. The fact he openly admitted that he generally hates live action remake but agreed to direct because he wanted to do it justice rather than having some blow in take over, I have massive respect.

I saw it today with my fiancé and we both really enjoyed it. It's nowhere near as good as the original, but Dean still managed to capture the spirit of HTTYD. Let me tell you this, ""The Lion King"" is my favourite film. The 2019 remake is my least favourite film. The original HTTYD is my second favourite film. I was burned before, no pun intended. I'm happy to say I wasn't burned here.

"Remake checked the boxes but was not better than any of the animated. 

I was disappointed in Mason and Nico’s chemistry, there had to be a better pair to play them. Mason was alright most of the time, but Nico’s dialogue and expression were so blocky and felt so forced. All of there interactions just were not very believable at all. Made me cringe every time they were together. 

All of the background characters plus Gerard Butler have the Scottish accents but none of the main characters? Dialogue was already bad enough but they sound like a bunch of Americans. We could’ve at least tried to get that part right. 

Environments and CGI were as good as they could be. Obviously Dragons had to be cgi and were made well, all of the environments fit really well too. Tootheless could’ve been a little more variated from the animated version. All of the other dragons got a very realistic remake that looked good in my opinion, but toothless was the exact same. 

There were some iconic moments and lines that were changed just enough for a fan of the originals to notice, but there were also some good changes which added a little more comedic relief than the animated. 

8/10, hope for better in the sequel remake.

"Just came out of the movie, here's my 2c out of the hat.

What struck me the most coming out of the movie were all the little details that show how much Dean DeBlois cares about his work. You can really feel that this live action isn’t just a plain adaptation, but rather a piece that fits thoughtfully into the rest of the saga. There’s genuine respect for the original universe, without falling into lazy copycat. 

What I found especially refreshing was the absence the fan service moment. Sure, there are a few nods and jokes of the original one, but they still avoided to recreate the iconic and fun scene (like the explosion behind Astrid, or Hiccup fainting after freeing Toothless), which is a good thing. It gives the film space to build its own references, to lay its own foundation. 

Some other comments 

I think the whole build-up around Toothless’s mechanical tail, and Hiccup’s work to adapt it, was really well done. 

I liked the space above the hall, gave a cozy vibe. :) 

I really liked how the village elder was given more presence. From the Viking fate reading with the bones to the look on her face when they take Toothless away, as you can tell that deep down, she too might believe there’s another way. 

I actually really liked Astrid in this version, I know the animated film was aimed at kids, but I always found her unbearable in it. Here, she’s way more nuanced, more interesting. She finally gets to be a believable character, not just the standard badass love interest.

Even Snoutlout surprised me. He doesn’t necessarily talk more, but there are these really short shots that say everything about his relationship with his father. And these tiny moments are enough to give him a new kind of depth I’d never noticed before. Well done. 

I honestly have a lot of hope for the third film now. (I know the second gonna be awesome) because I feel like DeBlois is going to keep shining a light on aspects that were a bit overlooked before. For the third movie, I really hope they move away from the overdone romance between Toothless and Toothpaste and explore something with a new angle.

"Another point about the dragon that I forgot to say.

For me, the biggest achievement of the film was getting me to believe in the look of a “real” Toothless. Since the first trailer to the very first seconds in the film, something about his face felt off. Honestly, I would have maybe tweaked a few things, maybe to make it closer to the animated version (especially in the details around the head). But as the film went on, it bothered me less and less, and by the end, it hardly stood out at all.

I guess it’s something they must have thought through for a long time. Maybe if they’d made him too close to the animated version, he would’ve looked too friendly? Or just out of place. After all, these are still supposed to be dragons that scare humans in theysotry, not oversized pets! 

That being said, I’m glad the Toothless from the Universal Studios park kept a design that leans more toward the animated version than the live-action one. It shows that there was some real effort behind the visual direction and that the design choices were deliberate, depending on the context.

Tldr: yes they went for dragons that are uncanny rather than cute, and honestly, that’s a good thing. They’re dragons, they’re supposed to be a little scary",Another point dragon forgot say biggest achievement film getting believe look real Toothless Since first trailer very first seconds film something face felt Honestly would maybe tweaked few things maybe make closer animated version especially details around head film went bothered less less end hardly stood guess something must thought long time Maybe theyd made too close animated version wouldve looked too friendly just place still supposed dragons scare humans theysotry not oversized pets said Im glad Toothless Universal Studios park kept design leans more toward animated version than liveaction one shows some real effort behind visual direction design choices deliberate depending context Tldr yes went dragons uncanny rather than cute honestly thats good thing Theyre dragons theyre supposed little scary

"It was a solid 6/10. It’s enjoyable but nothing out of ordinary. Few scenes were unnecessary. 

The chemistry between FL and ML is forced. Suddenly she kissed him, without any hints of having interest in the ML. Almost only shows ML’s side, so she kissed him out of nowhere, no connection whatsoever, it felt unearned. The FL has no charm. I hated her character and my sister felt the same. I didn’t hate the character in the animated version. 

The Viking Dad, I know he’s a famous actor but he’s overacting a lot. The guy that lost his leg and hand done it very nicely. British actors tend to do the humor better than American, very forced. 


Towards the final arc, at some point I was almost leaving because… it’s dragging. I’ve already watched the animated version so I know what’s gonna happen, and the movie?… just unnecessary.


TL;DR: movie is a fest of visual effect (that is if you’re being generous). Otherwise, no charm.",solid enjoyable nothing ordinary Few scenes unnecessary chemistry FL ML forced Suddenly kissed without hints interest ML Almost only shows MLs side so kissed nowhere no connection whatsoever felt unearned FL no charm hated character sister felt same didnt hate character animated version Viking Dad know hes famous actor hes overacting lot guy lost leg hand done very nicely British actors tend humor better than American very forced Towards final arc some point almost leaving dragging Ive already watched animated version so know whats gonna happen movie just unnecessary TLDR movie fest visual effect youre generous Otherwise no charm

"as a long time fan of HTTYD, i personally enjoyed it and am glad they brought in a bunch of people who were a part of the original movie (dean deblois, gerard butler, john powell). i didn’t have high expectations for sure, but i’m glad i went because i was thoroughly surprised. it was a shot for shot remake, which is what most people usually want in a love action remake, no? it is definitely one of the better live action remake movies and people are making it out to seem it’s like the other remakes. which i totally disagree with.",long time fan HTTYD personally enjoyed glad brought bunch people part original movie dean deblois gerard butler john powell didnt high expectations sure im glad went thoroughly surprised shot shot remake most people usually want love action remake no definitely one better live action remake movies people making seem like other remakes totally disagree
"it lacks the charming personality and the colorful world (despite the gray filter) of the original

"Are these remakes actually really that profitable for them to make it so soon for the new population?

It's only been 15 years, surely another original movie in the genre can be greenlit for 150 million. It's not like technology has advanced so much that a remake was required.

Maybe i'm just a boomer but i'd rather something 30 years old that hasn't been seen by the mass and/or is dated from the technology.

Like Small Soldiers, Antz, Street Fighter (lol) or even the Iron Giant (animation still holds up but could be updated, its a gem that should be seen by everyone).",remakes actually really profitable make so soon new population only years surely another original movie genre can greenlit million not like technology advanced so much remake required Maybe im just boomer id rather something years old hasnt seen mass andor dated technology Like Small Soldiers Antz Street Fighter lol even Iron Giant animation still holds could updated gem should seen everyone

"I got a free ticket to this today. I saw the original when it came out and loved it. But its been 15 yrs so i cant compare it side to side. Like most people here im tired of cash grab remakes, also Animation is my favorite medium and it bums me out that lots of adults think its “kids stuff” which is a big reason why live action remakes are so profitable.

That being said…

You could tell that lots of love and money was put into this. Its not complete CGI slop like the disney remakes.  Lots of the sets were physical sets with tons of artistry and detail. It was giving Wicked. The props were great, the costumes and armor (of the adult Vikings atleast) were detailed and beautiful. The CGI was GREAT. A design like toothless shouldnt work in live action but it somehow does. The giant kaiju dragon was genuinely scary. Honestly the CGI in this just made me angry at Disney and Jurassic world for doing the absolute least. The CGI in the jurassic rebirth trailers is TERRIBLE and this movie just proved to me that they could be doing so much better. And i doubt this movie had a higher budget than disney/JP does.

All in all, shot-by-shot live action remakes are completely unecessary but if they MUST exist this should be the blueprint.",got free ticket today saw original came loved yrs so cant compare side side Like most people im tired cash grab remakes also Animation favorite medium bums lots adults think kids stuff big reason live action remakes so profitable said could tell lots love money put not complete CGI slop like disney remakes Lots sets physical sets tons artistry detail giving Wicked props great costumes armor adult Vikings atleast detailed beautiful CGI GREAT design like toothless shouldnt work live action somehow giant kaiju dragon genuinely scary Honestly CGI just made angry Disney Jurassic world absolute least CGI jurassic rebirth trailers TERRIBLE movie just proved could so much better doubt movie higher budget than disneyJP shotbyshot live action remakes completely unecessary MUST exist should blueprint

"I think there are some things that they did better in this remake.


They never gave any backstory on Astrid in the original, so this version deepens her motivation in the first half of the movie. 


And I believe there's more of an emphasis on scenic shots, which looked really good because it's live-action. 


There are dialogue and scene cuts, so I'd say the original is better, but I can't say the live-action is totally worthless in my eyes. ",think some things better remake never gave backstory Astrid original so version deepens motivation first half movie believe theres more emphasis scenic shots looked really good liveaction dialogue scene cuts so Id say original better cant say liveaction totally worthless eyes
"We just watched it...

Just watch the OG. This is an obvious money grab, and while it's not horrible, stacked next to the much better voice acted and animated human characters(Dobber's Craig Ferguson is the most notable missing link) and the seriously absent charm and overall personality of Toothless, this just misses the mark.

"Holy cow you can’t make anyone happy. 

Disney remakes a ton of stories and actually changes up the story to fit a different narrative, everyone blows up and hates it. 

Dreamworks remakes this one almost beat for beat, knowing that people haven’t responded well to writers changing the story, and people say it’s pointless. 

I saw this one today and thought it was genuinely fantastic. I really like animation but seeing my favorite animated movie being “brought to life” was magnificent. It’s the same story, yes, but *enhanced*. Of course it’s not for everyone, but dang y’all, they did a great job considering the more recent live action remakes.

"Just watched the movie and as an avid httyd fan and httyd ao3 reader. I loved it. Yes, it’s nearly a shot for shot remake, but that’s all I wanted for this. I can appreciate the small changes they made and they weren’t such horrible big changes that ruined the movie for me. They made sense. For example (spoiler I guess), during Hiccup and Toothless’ first flight at the end they got chard by Toothless’ fire blast. They ended up going through the village and running into Astrid briefly. That’s a very endearing part of the cartoon that gives a lot of personality and humor. I can understand why they removed that from the movie because it probably would’ve been very hard to make that scene look even slightly natural since it was all cramped spaces and having hiccup and Toothless getting very close together and making a mess. I’d rather they removed that scene than try to keep it in and botch it. Same can be said about the dragonnip one. The results of that “weakness” and the secret scratch weakness are very similar and I actually like how they added the goofiness of the dandelions making the dragons sneeze because it adds more variety. 

You can call me sappy, but I honestly cried at some of my favorite scenes because seeing them in live action helped me to feel the original emotion even more intensely. Not to mention hearing the elevated versions of the original soundtrack literally choked me up. I hold this series near and dear to my heart and I’m in no way disappointed with this movie and I’m glad it came out so I could relive one of my favorite childhood movies. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’m with most people where I’m tired of all these remakes and would looove an actual new creative piece of media, but this live action is truly one of the best I’ve watched. If you have some apprehension of watching it because you’re against the whole live action remake trend, then maybe at least watch some clips and give it a small chance. Or don’t, I can’t control y’all’s choices lol but at least try not bashing it too hard without watching even a little bit of the movie. K that’s all I have to say. I’m going to go down the rabbit hole of httyd ao3 fics again now that this has reawakened my passion for it. Also any other avid fans of httyd gimme fanfic recs please lol. :)

"Seeing this version made me appreciate the original even more. Original came out when I was a kid, and I watched it so much back then that when seeing this new version, I can tell what lines were not in the original despite not having seen the original in 10+ years. I could also tell when the tone of certain lines was off in this new version, which takes me to my main gripe.

A good 90% of the actors seem like they never saw the original. Gerard Butler as Stoic (again) was perfect, but the rest of the cast really struggled with delivery. It seemed like they did one take after reading the script 30 seconds prior and called it good. A lot of the lighthearted and heavier moments just didn’t hit as hard.

It was fine/10. I’ll stick with the original though.",Seeing version made appreciate original even more Original came kid watched so much back seeing new version can tell lines not original despite not seen original years could also tell tone certain lines new version takes main gripe good actors seem like never saw original Gerard Butler Stoic perfect rest cast really struggled delivery seemed like one take reading script seconds prior called good lot lighthearted heavier moments just didnt hit hard fine Ill stick original though

Unless you are already squeamish with 3d glasses I don't see it being an issue.

"Ignoring all my useless little gripes I thought the dragons looked really good, especially the red death. My biggest problem by far though was how little emotion went into hiccups lines it just felt wrong the entire movie like it was straight off the script. Another thing I noticed while rewatching the animated film is that they completely removed the scene of hiccup and toothless relaxing when the terrors show up to steal food and toothless shoots one setting up the move where they blow up the red death from the inside later in the movie.

Overall, the live action just feels like an unnecessary cash grab.",Ignoring useless little gripes thought dragons looked really good especially red death biggest problem far though little emotion went hiccups lines just felt wrong entire movie like straight script Another thing noticed rewatching animated film completely removed scene hiccup toothless relaxing terrors show steal food toothless shoots one setting move blow red death inside later movie Overall live action just feels like unnecessary cash grab

It would have been SO COOL if they made all the dragons look scary and not like oversized cats. They could have had the Vikings be real people, too. Cursing, actually getting hurt, and bleeding juuuust a little bit. None of the “Stoic magically having super human strength and pummeling dragons for fun” stuff. The live action completely destroys the way that the Vikings interact with the dragons. I miss the Lord of the Rings era of CGI when it felt so much more real!!

"The original is one of my all-time favourite animated movies.

"Saw the movie today. This live-action adaptation is quite faithful to the original in most scenes. There have been some changes here and there, both in terms of character design (mainly Astrid and the dragons) and character motivations (again, mainly Astrid, who at the beginning seems to be more focused on money and economic status than glory from the battlefield). The live-action changed some scenes from the original, cutting out some bits and expanding other parts. This was likely done to compensate for the longer time real actors need to express emotion compared to animation. That, combined with some slightly longer action sequences, explains the additional 27 minutes.

A longer movie means having to rework the original score as well, and keeping John Powell as the composer was definitely the right move. He did a good job tailoring together the movie leitmotifs to fill in the gaps between the sections that were 1:1 with the original movie. I was only disappointed in one scene:>!the Test Drive score, which plays in the scene where Hiccup and Toothless properly fly together for the first time, has a specific structure. At the time when they fly too high and briefly detach from each other and start plummeting, there is an abrupt interruption of the music, which immediately resumes in an orchestral crescendo. While they fall, in the original, the music becomes more tense to underline that both characters are panicking. Then, as Hiccup realises that he has to trust his gut and Toothless, there is the release, and we hear Hiccup's and Toothless' themes combine for the first time. In the live-action, the ""tense"" falling scene needs a bit more time, and the beginning of the fall is scored by silence. No sound, like you see in a war or action movie when an explosion happens very close to the protagonist. For me, it just dispelled all the musical tension and weakened the following release, consequently weakening one of the two key scenes of the original movie.!<

About the dragons, I liked their more ""realistic"" design, especially the Mostrous Nightmare. I think they could have emphasized Toothless' expressions a bit more and ramped up his cuteness factor, since he is still completely animated, but it worked fine nonetheless.

**Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and I can definitely recommend watching the movie if you haven't seen the original in a while. It's not a MUST watch, but I don't feel like I wasted money on it.** This movie obviously can't outdo the original because of the human actors, not because they're incompetent, but simply due to the reduced expressivity of real humans that are acting on dialogue designed for animated characters most of the time. For me, personally, it was really interesting to see everything play out with human characters, particularly the young Vikings.

For those complaining about the lack of novelty, I would argue that this movie does exactly what I expect from a live-action remake: follow the original plot, which made the movie so good, but do it with real people, costumes, and sets as much as possible. Of course, sometimes the lighting mismatch was noticeable, but never too bothersome.

For those who wished that this movie were more faithful to the books: your passion made me want to read the books, but remember that this is a *remake*, not a *reboot*, of the original movie. I get that you wanted a more faithful adaptation of the books, but seeing what happened with Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Tales from Earthsea and Dune (and probably many others that don't come to mind atm), I have kinda lost faith in the possibility of adapting long stories to movie series while preserving the original content. The creators who work in the ""receiving"" media might want to add their personal touch to the narrative or character design, and in the case of HTTYD, the ""loosely adapted"" story is still pretty good. Also, there aren't as many movie directors as devoted as Peter Jackson, who sacrificed years of his life to LOTR to deliver a cohesive and well-made movie adaptation. Maybe it can be done with the TV series format?",Saw movie today liveaction adaptation quite faithful original most scenes some changes terms character design mainly Astrid dragons character motivations mainly Astrid beginning seems more focused money economic status than glory battlefield liveaction changed some scenes original cutting some bits expanding other parts likely done compensate longer time real actors need express emotion compared animation combined some slightly longer action sequences explains additional minutes longer movie means rework original score well keeping John Powell composer definitely right move good job tailoring together movie leitmotifs fill gaps sections original movie only disappointed one scenethe Test Drive score plays scene Hiccup Toothless properly fly together first time specific structure time fly too high briefly detach each other start plummeting abrupt interruption music immediately resumes orchestral crescendo fall original music becomes more tense underline characters panicking Hiccup realises trust gut Toothless release hear Hiccups Toothless themes combine first time liveaction tense falling scene needs bit more time beginning fall scored silence No sound like see war action movie explosion happens very close protagonist just dispelled musical tension weakened following release consequently weakening one two key scenes original movie dragons liked more realistic design especially Mostrous Nightmare think could emphasized Toothless expressions bit more ramped cuteness factor since still completely animated worked fine nonetheless Overall enjoyable experience can definitely recommend watching movie havent seen original not MUST watch dont feel like wasted money movie obviously cant outdo original human actors not theyre incompetent simply due reduced expressivity real humans acting dialogue designed animated characters most time personally really interesting see everything play human characters particularly young Vikings complaining lack novelty would argue movie exactly expect liveaction remake follow original plot made movie so good real people costumes sets much possible course sometimes lighting mismatch noticeable never too bothersome wished movie more faithful books passion made want read books remember remake not reboot original movie get wanted more faithful adaptation books seeing happened Harry Potter Hunger Games Tales Earthsea Dune probably many others dont come mind atm kinda lost faith possibility adapting long stories movie series preserving original content creators work receiving media might want add personal touch narrative character design case HTTYD loosely adapted story still pretty good Also arent many movie directors devoted Peter Jackson sacrificed years life LOTR deliver cohesive wellmade movie adaptation Maybe can done TV series format

Also this movie isn't just for us fans, it is definitely for those who haven't seen the original trilogy. It is a nice touch to have another version for them to enjoy and to pull them in to the world of dragons.

"To be honest, the movie feels like what the original should have been. I think if the original author/director didnt have the technology and budget constraints that we did in 2010, it would have been live action.  So seeing dragons in live action like this just fits so well to the story to be honest. It feels very copy and paste to the animation but that's not really a complaint.

"That kinda makes sense pacing in animation and live action are pretty different. You can spend way less time on scenes in animation due to how easy it is for characters to emote and express themselves.

Live action humans tend to take longer to do it. Lilo and Stitch ran into that issue where they tried to pace the emotional scenes the same as the original animation. And it just didn't hit as hard.",kinda makes sense pacing animation live action pretty different can spend way less time scenes animation due easy characters emote express Live action humans tend take longer Lilo Stitch ran issue tried pace emotional scenes same original animation just didnt hit hard

2) confused when Toothless shows up to save Hiccup in the arena

3) Preceding Toothless and Hiccup showing up as the cavalry.

4) When Toothless playfully dives onto the villagers at the end.

"This is why, from a critical point of view, remaking well liked films is an incredibly risky thing to do.

If you remake a film almost beat for beat you open yourself up to direct comparisons. Unless you nail absolutely every beat from casting, to effects, to tone and pacing most people will just return to the original 'superior' product. At best you just have to hope for something that will survive alongside the original.

If you change up from the original you run the risk of the 'original worked better' comparisons. If the original is already a really well liked story those comparisons are going to be even harder to overcome, so you have to go even harder on the changes incurring more risk at creating a different well liked product.

Ultimately the biggest take away from these films is 'whats the point in remaking something thats already good?' (Well the answer is money, and making money off nostalgia and recognisability). The better course would be to remake lesser films that had good ideas but poor execution. As long as you correctly identify where the original went wrong you can implement changes and additions to enhance the product, without the fear or worry of being overshadowed by the original.",critical point view remaking well liked films incredibly risky thing remake film almost beat beat open direct comparisons Unless nail absolutely every beat casting effects tone pacing most people will just return original superior product best just hope something will survive alongside original change original run risk original worked better comparisons original already really well liked story comparisons going even harder overcome so go even harder changes incurring more risk creating different well liked product Ultimately biggest take away films whats point remaking something thats already good Well answer money making money nostalgia recognisability better course would remake lesser films good ideas poor execution long correctly identify original went wrong can implement changes additions enhance product without fear worry overshadowed original

"I thought I’d be annoyed by how she doesn’t look like the character, but I found instead that I was more annoyed bc I thought her acting was lacking. She felt like a very toned-down, passive version of the animated Astrid. A lot of her lines didn’t really hit that well for me because of that.

And, because of that it did annoy me that they also changed her appearance. Lacklustre acting and she looks completely different? Why. I swear they hired her because she could do flips or something.

"Ah we differ greatly here.

I thought Astrid’s actor was one of the strongest in the movie. Perfect mix between stoic and mighty and a self doubting teenager with a growing crush for Hiccup. And they explained it well in the movie.

You have to suspend your disbelief in the original trilogy anyways because the Viking’s on our screens clearly aren’t true to life and exist in their own realm of fantasy. And the dragons that appear differ to dragons you’d find in Norse Mythology anyways. Hiccup has an American accent in the original movie and I never see people bring that up as immersive-breaking",Ah differ greatly thought Astrids actor one strongest movie Perfect mix stoic mighty self doubting teenager growing crush Hiccup explained well movie suspend disbelief original trilogy anyways Vikings screens clearly arent true life exist own realm fantasy dragons appear differ dragons youd find Norse Mythology anyways Hiccup American accent original movie never see people bring immersivebreaking

I get it when we think a remake is unnecessary. But it's not the ""money"" or ""profit making"" that I personally dislikes. It's how they are not appreciating what makes the OGs well-loved.

HTTYD follows the OG. The filmmakers are onboard.

So the best they could do to keep the marketing timeline in place for the park is to dust off the original script, put a fresh coat of paint on it, and hope people like watching it a second time lol it's just an ad for the park and merch anyway so from a business perspective it's not a huge deal if it flops.

Yeah, I get you. I loved everything about her acting and her personality wise except for the hair/ no blonde wig. She has the right facial features for it and her face and mannerisms in a lot of shots are definitely the spitting image of her animated counterpart. 

If I’m not mistaken, the actress has had blonde hair before, so it’s interesting how they didn’t give her blonde hair in the film. 

I think had they kept her hair the same, (or at least the same colour) less people would have been complaining about it but there’s no denying that she still did a fantastic job embodying her.",Yeah get loved everything acting personality wise except hair no blonde wig right facial features face mannerisms lot shots definitely spitting image animated counterpart Im not mistaken actress blonde hair so interesting didnt give blonde hair film think kept hair same least same colour less people would complaining theres no denying still fantastic job embodying

Of course! I’m not denying that her acting was phenomenal and Nico embodied her to the next level, and whilst you’re right this remake isn’t accurate to Vikings at all because of obvious factors such as the dragons and Hiccup being a Viking with an American accent, many people (myself included) just simply weren’t keen on Astrid’s hair colour in particular and wanted her to solely be an iconic blondie like her animated counterpart but that doesn’t mean everything else in the film had to be accurate. 

There’s been a lot of edits of her going around here on the internet with blonde her and she practically looks like the spitting image of her and it’s crazy. She had the right face for it though and I feel like had they had stuck with giving her a blonde hair (even just as a wig) it would have been the cherry on top but that’s just me. Still a great adaption though! ",course Im not denying acting phenomenal Nico embodied next level whilst youre right remake isnt accurate Vikings obvious factors such dragons Hiccup Viking American accent many people included just simply werent keen Astrids hair colour particular wanted solely iconic blondie like animated counterpart doesnt mean everything else film accurate Theres lot edits going around internet blonde practically looks like spitting image crazy right face though feel like stuck giving blonde hair even just wig would cherry top thats just Still great adaption though

The longer runtime is attributed to certain sequences being given more of a chance to breath and the odd dialogue added here and there, but the pacing remains strong and doesn't feel like bloat. 

Reddit will cry about this movie even though it remaining faithful means it doesn't run the risk of ruining the story. Would much rather this compared to the shit that the Lilo and Stitch remake did where the ending completely misses the point and they cut characters or moments for budgetary reasons.",Yeah whats funny reviews overwhelmingly positive very respectable average ratings course comments full people havent seen movie slagging positive reviews proving right Saw movie today loved funny seeing so many people criticising CGI despite couple dodgy green screen backgrounds theres plenty practical locations sets dragon CGI insane longer runtime attributed certain sequences given more chance breath odd dialogue added pacing remains strong doesnt feel like bloat Reddit will cry movie even though remaining faithful means doesnt run risk ruining story Would much rather compared shit Lilo Stitch remake ending completely misses point cut characters moments budgetary reasons

"Tony Todd's character backstory reveal of Bludworth and how he knows so much about death, the design, cheating it and skipping, is finally explained and it might be one of my favourites of all time in any film series I have seen.

He was in the tower as a little child in 1969. He was saved by Iris and in her premonition, he was the last to die. So Iris and her entire lineage had to die before he as a character could.  That's why he knew so much in every single film, with Alex in FD1, Clear and Kimberly in FD2 and so on and so forth in every film he made an appearance.

After he survived in 1969 and all the survivors and their families/lineage that was never supposed to exist start to die off, yet Bludworth was always going to be the last one to die because he was the last one saved in Iris's premonition and as a result of that, as he gets older he meets up (off screen) with Iris and discusses, researches, learns everything about what to do try and stay alive and how to beat death.

Wonderful lore and incredible added backstory to the character of William ""J.B"" Bludworth played by Tony Todd who gave a very touching lovely final speech in this film too.

I really enjoyed Tony Todd's final scene. We finally get closure and answers for a character that left us with so many questions, left us scared, creeped out but that final scene of his, it answers all these questions and it humanised him.

Bludworth was just waiting for his time to die the moment he realised he was on Death's list and he couldn't do anything but wait, and seeing Iris's grandchildren at the hospital must've been a big relief that after all this time, he doesn't have to wonder how long, it's almost over.

"> As the Final Destination films have continued on, they’ve gotten meaner, less superficially concerned with survival and more explicitly giddy at the prospect of a nasty death trap or a jumpy “crushed by a huge thing in an instant” reversal. Final Destination Bloodlines embraces this late-period slasher-minus-slasher construction, with Lipovsky and Stein eagerly constructing deaths into applause moments celebrated with the same bursts of bloody confetti.

"Saw this on Sunday with my sister, both of us long time FD buffs.

75 on Metacritic is actually justified.

The kills are some of my favorites in the entire series because this time there's very little fakeout buildup to subvert expectations. There's some humor sprinkled in there but you can really tell the movie is made by people who know the series so there're no Marvel level unnecessary quips. The premise is taken seriously and the comedy really comes from letting the scene breathe exactly the right amount.

The movie also gets a big boost for not really having any characters you can't wait to die. No sleazebags, pervs or over-the-top assholes getting their gory comeuppance which is honestly refreshing (>!the kid in the beginning is a gray area, IMO he was just being a kid!<). I also don't understand the critic comments about dysfunctional families, the families here were very warm and close to each other aside from the two women who both warm up to the rest pretty quickly once they're introduced, this is nowhere near the level of the recent Halloween sequels. Erik seemed like the kind of character I would hate when he was introduced, >!but he actually became my favorite seeing how he took the revelation and still was all in on helping his family of choice. Seeing his super warm dad go and him dealing with it was surprisingly sweet. Him surviving the ""leaked"" scene was a nice twist.!<

I enjoyed the easter eggs left for fans of the series and it was nice to see >!no references to the tragedies of the previous movies, aside from the end credits.!<

The ending was abrupt, even on FD standards, but all in all it's probably the best in the series after the first two, maybe even taking the second place.",Saw Sunday sister us long time FD buffs Metacritic actually justified kills some favorites entire series time theres very little fakeout buildup subvert expectations Theres some humor sprinkled can really tell movie made people know series so therere no Marvel level unnecessary quips premise taken seriously comedy really comes letting scene breathe exactly right amount movie also gets big boost not really characters cant wait die No sleazebags pervs overthetop assholes getting gory comeuppance honestly refreshing kid beginning gray area IMO just kid also dont understand critic comments dysfunctional families families very warm close each other aside two women warm rest pretty quickly theyre introduced nowhere near level recent Halloween sequels Erik seemed like kind character would hate introduced actually became favorite seeing took revelation still helping family choice Seeing super warm dad go dealing surprisingly sweet surviving leaked scene nice twist enjoyed easter eggs left fans series nice see no references tragedies previous movies aside end credits ending abrupt even FD standards probably best series first two maybe even taking second place

Every death is drawn the fuck out and they subvert your expectations by having characters basically lying to each other in order to disrupt the rules. The ONLY gripe I had was a story problem. >!The entire premise of the movie is that the grandmother has been locked away for like 70 years in this cabin ""avoiding death,"" and she came up with this entire theory about how everyone who survived her premonition was dying in the exact order, starting from them to their descendants to the next person. Therefore, because she knew she was 2nd last, she knew she would be safe and wouldn’t be dying when she initially went into hiding. It’s literally her death that sets every other death into motion, which means the cabin never kept her safe — it just wasn’t her turn. She basically wasted her entire life until it was her turn, and she died at the cabin almost instantly. And the characters know all this — they have all the timelines and shit — but they ignore that the only reason she lived was because it wasn’t her turn yet.!<",Just got Final Destination film like very very good Youre getting exactly asked Every death drawn fuck subvert expectations characters basically lying each other order disrupt rules ONLY gripe story problem entire premise movie grandmother locked away like years cabin avoiding death came entire theory everyone survived premonition dying exact order starting descendants next person Therefore knew nd last knew would safe wouldnt dying initially went hiding literally death sets every other death motion means cabin never kept safe just wasnt turn basically wasted entire life turn died cabin almost instantly characters know timelines shit ignore only reason lived wasnt turn yet

This probably has to balance a new audience to catch them up on the lore but because of this it never really seems to be that unique. It’s a tough job but I felt like the story was very safe.  

The most intense moment was the first 15 or so mins then you’re much more whelmed. It’s safe and outside exploring Tony Todd’s character there wasn’t much else. It’s more a 6/10 imo.

What brings me joy is that it isn't just a cheap cash grab like so many revived franchises, it was an actual good movie. The opening sequence is definitely the best until now, the story was better than usual since there has to be a certain formula to follow to get this sort of story to work, I liked the characters, it was funny but not in a unfitting way and it followed the continuity of the previous movies.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it and I really hope we get to see more again with this franchise.

"I really enjoyed it and I do appreciate that it feels like this one made a little bit more effort than most of the others to actually make the victims feel like real characters rather than just meat sponges and thus I actually felt bad when the characters died.

really my only complaint is the ending just being the usual over the top wink wink style death of the main characters as I really wish the franchise would actually try more new things with its endings.

like either allowing characters to actually get happy endings ( outside of the second film but even that one is kinda undercut by the wink wink surprise death at the end )  or just find new creative ways to have dark endings.

but just going with the exact same sort of thing that we've seen multiple times before just felt disappointing tbh.",really enjoyed appreciate feels like one made little bit more effort than most others actually make victims feel like real characters rather than just meat sponges thus actually felt bad characters died really only complaint ending just usual top wink wink style death main characters really wish franchise would actually try more new things endings like either allowing characters actually get happy endings outside second film even one kinda undercut wink wink surprise death end just find new creative ways dark endings just going exact same sort thing weve seen multiple times just felt disappointing tbh

Final Destination Bloodlines - 8/10. Well I guess I skipped number 5 before I got to see the new instalment. “Final Destination Bloodlines” follows the formula that fans have grown to love with the series, but, there’s some slight twists and turns along the way. But before I get into this film it self, I wanna say: that was such a beautiful send off for Tony Todd. Its really rare a franchise is able to send off a character or star in a very poignant or meaningful manner. And here, Todd delivers his last performance, which feels prophetic and heartwarming. Its almost as though he knew, and the way his scene goes about you can’t help but feel that this was a beautiful sendoff to a horror icon. Not only do they honour him as an actor, but they also surprisingly bring some depth and closure for his character in the franchise too (something I wasn’t really expecting, but pleasantly surprised by). Now, for the film. For starters, I would still say the original is the best, the third is the second best, and this one is probably the third best in the series. What Bloodlines does smartly is that the film is super aware about the goings of a Final Destination story. This is definitely, by far, the most self aware film in the franchise thus far. You can also put up an argument that this might be the fastest paced film in the franchise (once it gets into the eventual premonitions and deaths). But ironically, its not a Final Destination film that I will compare this to. In fact, I would say this is the Final Destination adaptation of the 2018 instalment in the “Halloween” franchise. Like that film, we have characters here who have cheated death, and that has caused turmoil in their personal lives, so much so that they either become paranoid shut ins, or, absentee parents. I was really surprised how much this movie borrowed from that instalment (not that I’m complaining, cause I like that film). The movie’s set pieces are fun, and the first and last set pieces are done in a big manner (though, the CGI is just a little distracting to be honest). There’s some creativity with the premonitions here, and the story is actually quite interesting as well. The continuity that the franchise really celebrates upon is also respected here as well, as we do get connections to past events (even if its not jaw dropping). Overall though, this is a solid return for the franchise, and a fun one at that.",Final Destination Bloodlines Well guess skipped number got see new instalment Final Destination Bloodlines follows formula fans grown love series theres some slight twists turns along way get film self wanna say such beautiful send Tony Todd really rare franchise able send character star very poignant meaningful manner Todd delivers last performance feels prophetic heartwarming almost though knew way scene goes cant help feel beautiful sendoff horror icon Not only honour actor also surprisingly bring some depth closure character franchise too something wasnt really expecting pleasantly surprised Now film starters would still say original best third second best one probably third best series Bloodlines smartly film super aware goings Final Destination story definitely far most self aware film franchise thus far can also put argument might fastest paced film franchise gets eventual premonitions deaths ironically not Final Destination film will compare fact would say Final Destination adaptation instalment Halloween franchise Like film characters cheated death caused turmoil personal lives so much so either become paranoid shut ins absentee parents really surprised much movie borrowed instalment not Im complaining cause like film movies set pieces fun first last set pieces done big manner though CGI just little distracting honest Theres some creativity premonitions story actually quite interesting well continuity franchise really celebrates upon also respected well get connections past events even not jaw dropping Overall though solid return franchise fun one

"One thing that doesn’t sit right with Final Destination: Bloodlines is the new bloodline lore. If this film is meant to retroactively explain that all the events in the previous movies are connected through a single bloodline (survivors of the Sky Deck accident), it just doesn’t hold up.

The earlier films all revolve around completely random groups: high school students (FD1 and FD3), traffic accident survivors (FD2), race track spectators (FD4), and coworkers from a corporate retreat (FD5). None of these groups had any hints or connections suggesting they were linked through ancestry or a shared legacy.

So how could these supposedly random people all be descendants of a single group of Sky Deck survivors from decades ago? The characters come from different states, age groups, races, and walks of life. It feels like a forced retcon that actually undermines the franchise’s original theme — that Death is a random force, and no one is truly safe. If everything is tied to a bloodline now, it removes the chaotic neutrality that made the concept so unsettling.

Anyone else feel like the new lore contradicts the core of what made Final Destination so effective?",One thing doesnt sit right Final Destination Bloodlines new bloodline lore film meant retroactively explain events previous movies connected single bloodline survivors Sky Deck accident just doesnt hold earlier films revolve around completely random groups high school students FD FD traffic accident survivors FD race track spectators FD coworkers corporate retreat FD None groups hints connections suggesting linked ancestry shared legacy So could supposedly random people descendants single group Sky Deck survivors decades ago characters come different states age groups races walks life feels like forced retcon actually undermines franchises original theme Death random force no one truly safe everything tied bloodline now removes chaotic neutrality made concept so unsettling Anyone else feel like new lore contradicts core made Final Destination so effective

"I think you felt underwhelmed by the deaths because this film departed from the previous entries’ set-ups where characters randomly enter dangerous scenarios in unique settings to be killed off (tanning beds, gym, acupuncture spa, lasik surgery, etc). Those played off of the success of the log truck making us afraid of being impaled by a log on a highway pile up. Directors were chasing that success by saying, “Look, here’s someone at an auto repair shop! What’s gonna get him? Bet you’ll never want to step foot in an auto repair shop again!” But I think that’s actually what held some of the older films back. The overly elaborate deaths were becoming more important than the story, characters, and writing. So here we saw a family actually legitimately trying to tackle this. They were in their own homes, backyards, the hospital, jogging down the street.",think felt underwhelmed deaths film departed previous entries setups characters randomly enter dangerous scenarios unique settings killed tanning beds gym acupuncture spa lasik surgery etc played success log truck making us afraid impaled log highway pile Directors chasing success saying Look heres someone auto repair shop Whats gonna get Bet youll never want step foot auto repair shop think thats actually held some older films back overly elaborate deaths becoming more important than story characters writing So saw family actually legitimately trying tackle own homes backyards hospital jogging street

>!He was in the tower as a little child in 1969. He was saved by Iris and in her premonition, he was the last to die. So Iris and her entire lineage had to die before he as a character could!<

That's why he knew so much in every single film, with Alex in FD1, Clear and Kimberly in FD2 and so on and so forth in every film he made an appearance.

>!After he survived in 1969 and all the survivors and their families/lineage that was never supposed to exist start to die off, yet Bludworth was always going to be the last one to die because he was the last one saved in Iris's premonition and as a result of that, as he gets older he meets up (off screen) with Iris and discusses, researches, learns everything about what to do try and stay alive and how to beat death!<

When he got older, he met up with the woman who saved him and learnt about death, cheating it and surviving (all off screen) and that's why he knows so much.

Whereas that wouldn't have happened back in the day.

I think SAW X is completely deserving of that praise.  But I'm biased because it's my favorite movie series of all time and has been for over 20 years.

But with Terrifier 2, Terrifier 3, and now Final Destination: Bloodlines?  I really do think there is some merit to that theory.

"Honestly, I don’t know if it’s just attributed to more critics having platforms that are favorably reviewing those films.  I think that argument diminishes the work of the filmmakers for those movies.

Back when the saw franchise was in its heyday, the movies were making bank and being pumped out every 18 months. As a result, you could tell the screenwriting process was rushed so the studios could capitalize on this popularity.

# “Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”",Yup Im Im constantly reminded CS Lewis quote see people conniptions feeling compelled shit things enjoy Critics treat adult term approval instead merely descriptive term cannot adult concerned grown admire grown grown blush suspicion childish things marks childhood adolescence childhood adolescence moderation healthy symptoms Young things ought want grow carry middle life even early manhood concern adult mark really arrested development ten read fairy tales secret would ashamed found so Now fifty read openly became man put away childish things including fear childishness desire very grown

"Rohirrim is weird because it’s a pretty good movie… but like, I don’t really get what the plan was. It looks like one of the Netflix anime movies, it feels like a solid streaming movie (I’ll be watching it on streaming again, it’s honestly good), even it’s premise feels like the synopsis of something that would be made for a streaming service. And given their abysmal advertising for it, and zero marketing plans, nothing about it feels like it was ever meant to be a theater experience. Did they do a theater release just to pad it’s profits before it’s normal streaming release? Was it always meant to be a theater release? It just feels so… off?

"So from what I heard is that Marvel sort of tricked them.  Spider-Man's first appearance was in ""Captain America : Civil War"" and that was a Marvel film.  Which means Disney hired him under their umbrella and because of that contract Disney has equal say in any use over the Peter Parker character that's specifically played by Tom Holland.  And because Tom is Spider-Man that means Sony isn't physically allowed to use Tom without Marvel's approval.  
  
If you remember Tom Holland [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NPFORuPCw) that Sony and Marvel stopped talking and he basically saved his own franchise by drunk dialing both CEOs.  This is over this contract thing.  Sony got pissed when they found out Marvel tricked them and they basically took their football home. They worked it out and they decided to go behind Marvel's back and just use random characters that they own the rights too.  This is what spawned these idiotic villain movies.  
  
It also has everything to do with the way Spiderman 3 ended.  With Peter Parker being physically removed from all connections to the Marvel universe.  Obviously, its open ended.  He could just walk back into that dinner and tell Ned and MJ that hes their friend and we can get them back but its also there specifically because Sony wants to make their own Spider-Man films with Tom. From what I hear they worked out their differences and Tom is continuing with the MCU, the fourth film is rumored to be a >!street level heroes film that takes place in New York and features Daredevil and Kingpin.!<  But thats a rumor so who the hell knows.",So heard Marvel sort tricked SpiderMans first appearance Captain America Civil War Marvel film means Disney hired umbrella contract Disney equal say use Peter Parker character thats specifically played Tom Holland Tom SpiderMan means Sony isnt physically allowed use Tom without Marvels approval remember Tom Holland revealed Sony Marvel stopped talking basically saved own franchise drunk dialing CEOs contract thing Sony got pissed found Marvel tricked basically took football home worked decided go behind Marvels back just use random characters own rights too spawned idiotic villain movies also everything way Spiderman ended Peter Parker physically removed connections Marvel universe Obviously open ended could just walk back dinner tell Ned MJ hes friend can get back also specifically Sony wants make own SpiderMan films Tom hear worked differences Tom continuing MCU fourth film rumored street level heroes film takes place New York features Daredevil Kingpin thats rumor so hell knows

"Their subject matter kind of is the problem. The only reason to brand a movie as ""Kraven"" rather than ""this completely original hunter guy we made up killing people for 2 hours"" is in the hopes that the brand recognition brings up something else, that taking an established character somehow adds value.

And here it doesn't.

Spider-Man villains can be fun when their point is to have Spider-Man punch them. But for the most part they're ridiculous freaks with a single shtick. The classic ones were literally created on the fly from concepts like ""a guy who is also a rhino"" (honestly a Rhino movie is the bottom of the barrel I dare Sony to scrape now).

Yeesh. Yeah, that could be a factor.

Princess Mononoke still looked fine because the source material was so good — just like it looked great on DVD on small CRT televisions — but in IMAX elements like background art had considerably lower detail than the original theatrical release and earlier Blu-ray. It was a very soft picture. The person I saw it with noticed this too.

I'm not sure if it's gotten a home release yet. That will make comparisons easy. It's also possible the IMAX release was worse, for whatever reasons. (They definitely screwed up the sound in the screening I saw.

"Down in Aussie, Fantastic Four actually held alright at 43% week 2 drop, which puts it exactly in the middle of all MCU Weekend 2 % drops.  

That said it's easier to maintain a lower % drop when the movie doesn't even open in the top 5 openings of the year. (FF opened as the 7th highest opening of the year down here).  

But as a silver lining, as with international it is now the highest Fantastic Four movie (Unadjusted for inflation) so yay for that and it's already almost closed the gap on both other MCU movies from this year and should pass them both in the next week or two without too much sweat.  

As usual down here we also have some Indian cinema making it's way into the weekly charts with both Chal Mera Putt 4 opening in number 5 and Saiyaara at number 8 after 3 weeks of release.

Which has been the problem over and over again with the MCU lately. 

Even what's good they make just baffling choices with. Like why do you take your strongest debut outside Black Panther and decide oh yeah for the sequel instead of more super saiyan girl blasting starships and flying around at mach 10 you're going to go with.... Freaky fucking Friday? Because **ha-ha** other girls have used the Marvel name? Yeah that was totally going to work on an audience who barely knows who Ms Marvel and Ms Nextwave are. Also totally a Wii U situation not calling Captain Marvel 2. 

As for First Steps well I dare suggest they were getting better but when Reed started talking about ""family dinner"" in the trailers they needed to immediately smash cut to some absolute disaster around the table with them all screaming at each other. Because the FF are Marvel's 'first family' because Kirby and Lee had the great innovation to write some actual fucking people with problems, concerns, and squabbles in contrast to the Justice League and early Silver Age heroes in general being immaculate (and often high handed) paladins of justice. The FF are a family because they aren't just a hero team up not because they exude any sort of wholesome classic family values. In fact they are a subversion albeit one that would become pretty damn standard across comics

There were a couple others that seemed like they only released in China in 2020 and 2021, but without those you have to go back nearly a decade for Inside Out and Secret Life of Pets for anything that would be considered original IP (I'm not counting Bohemian Rhapsody since, while it wasn't based on a book or anything, I'm not sure basing it on an actual person counts as original...)

Edit: In fact, it looks like the last time more than 3 (and at least half) of the top grossing movies weren't sequels, reboots, part of franchises, etc. was 2000, with Gladiator, Cast Away, What Women Want, Dinosaur, and What Lies Beneath (which I don't *think* was published before the movie...)",Hell way quite some time Last year top worldwide grossing movies very least sequels top much same year year top think only one wasnt reboot sequel based video game toy line book Full River Red Im not sure released theaters outside China couple others seemed like only released China without go back nearly decade Inside Secret Life Pets anything would considered original IP Im not counting Bohemian Rhapsody since wasnt based book anything Im not sure basing actual person counts original Edit fact looks like last time more than least half top grossing movies werent sequels reboots part franchises etc Gladiator Cast Away Women Want Dinosaur Lies Beneath dont think published movie

"How much does the target audience play into the turnout? The build-up to Infinity War/Endgame took 11 years and 22 films (23 if you include Far From Home which released just after Endgame) to come to completion. You're looking at an audience that watched Iron Man and Captain America when they were in elementary school and then Endgame when they were in/graduating from college. With Endgame and the films that came out afterwards, the audience then lost the Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor that they grew up supporting.  
  
Obviously there's space for new characters and heroes, but each new film is PG-13 and targeted at a younger audience. The films have also become very formulaic at this point, there are now supporting TV shows, and there's a constant churn of new characters getting introduced to replace the cast that bowed out in the hopes of finding the new marketable super-team. Add in the multiverse stuff and the people who aren't paying close attention have no idea what's going on and what characters are active.  
  
But ultimately, the core cast completed their stories and the kids who became attached to them are well into adulthood at this point. Those adults aren't as willing to watch 20+ PG-13 movies and TV shows setting up a new MCU storyline when the one they cared about has already finished. That doesn't mean that those people don't care about the MCU anymore, it just means that they're less invested these days and if they're going to watch one of these films, they're only going to turn out for the big ones with an ensemble cast. And they'll likely get the cliff notes of all the new characters before they watch it.  
  
Or actually, another random thought - all of these films end up on the rather cheap Disney+ platform within 2-3 months, so if people do care enough to watch these films, they're likely just waiting for them to hit the streaming platform.",much target audience play turnout buildup Infinity WarEndgame took years films include Far Home released just Endgame come completion Youre looking audience watched Iron Man Captain America elementary school Endgame ingraduating college Endgame films came afterwards audience lost Iron Man Captain America Black Widow Hawkeye Thor grew supporting Obviously theres space new characters heroes each new film PG targeted younger audience films also become very formulaic point now supporting TV shows theres constant churn new characters getting introduced replace cast bowed hopes finding new marketable superteam Add multiverse stuff people arent paying close attention no idea whats going characters active ultimately core cast completed stories kids became attached well adulthood point adults arent willing watch PG movies TV shows setting new MCU storyline one cared already finished doesnt mean people dont care MCU anymore just means theyre less invested days theyre going watch one films theyre only going turn big ones ensemble cast theyll likely get cliff notes new characters watch actually another random thought films end rather cheap Disney platform within months so people care enough watch films theyre likely just waiting hit streaming platform

"The issue isn’t the superhero genre. Deadpool and Wolverine made over $1 billion last year, GotG3 made over $800 million in 2023, The Batman made over $700 million in 2022 and Superman is doing pretty well at almost $600 million. Clearly there is still a healthy appetite for the genre. The real issues were more complex than that. For Marvel, the hype for the MCU had died down after the massive payoff that was Endgame and instead of building connective tissue to hype up the following movies and generate interest again, Marvel put out a slew of mid projects with no sense of direction for where the franchise was going. The hype of the Avengers films carried a lot of the more mid Phase 1 - 3 MCU movies to big success and there was nothing like that post Endgame until recently. 

In terms of DC, they had been in freefall since the failure of Justice League, completely aimless with no sense of direction at all, throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. James Gunn announcing the rebooted universe sealed the deal for the final DCEU movies, nobody wanted to invest in a movie in a franchise they know is dying ahead of time. Thunderbolts and F4 are still feeling the effects of Marvel’s bad decision making even though they’re being praised as the best Marvel movies in years.

"Hard disagree. I can't stand people trying to use this argument. The problem isn't superhero movie fatigue, the problem is that they keep making bad movies and shows. the movies are shit. It isn't any more complicated than that. You make bad movie after bad movie and people stop looking forward to your movies. If there is so much fatigue, why are there so many that i look forward to? Peacemaker, invincible, the boys; these are all examples of stuff i am waiting to see. i am not looking for to some new 'woke' boring marvel movie based on comics nobody likes in the first place, and then changed to be even worse than that. 

Take ironheart. Nobody liked those comics. Like nobody at all. That is just a fact. Yet they chose that out of the million other choices they had, to make a big series and create a new member of the mcu. That is already boring and lame. But then on top of that, they didn't even adapt her. They made her something completely different than her own comic. They changed everything about her character into something worse. Then the show very predictably bombs and people like you show up talking 'bout superhero fatique. the problem is that the show is bad. It is jsut that simple. On top of just being bad, it makes fans angry. This was hundreds of millions of dollars and the greater part of a decade wasted on something that nobody wanted that could have been used to make something people would love. So it's more than just the show is bad and I don't like it, we have actually been deprived of something we would gladly pay for.

The wrong people are in charge, and until that changes we will keep getting crap movies and shows. Even movies people end up actually liking, like fantastic 4, they are still on shaky ground. It still feels like someone who is out of touch is humoring some of the variables that the target audience says are important to make the kinds of movies they love and when the movies do succeed they don't actually understand what about it made that so. They are dancing on the edge of failure and people call it good enough.

The casuals might be tired of superheros, but there is a huge audience that is ready and eager for more, and that audience has the most disposable wealth to spend on such things. Make what the fans want and they will give you money. It doesn't get any simpler than that. The fans never wanted ironheart, it was always going to fail. Even in a thread talking about how fantastic 4 made nearly 400 million bucks you are over here saying people don't want to watch superhero movies any more. That is direct proof that you are wrong, whether the movie is considered a financial success or not. 400 million is not nothing and it certainly justifies them to keep making more movies, which is why that is exactly what they are going to keep doing.",Hard disagree cant stand people trying use argument problem isnt superhero movie fatigue problem keep making bad movies shows movies shit isnt more complicated than make bad movie bad movie people stop looking forward movies so much fatigue so many look forward Peacemaker invincible boys examples stuff waiting see not looking some new woke boring marvel movie based comics nobody likes first place changed even worse than Take ironheart Nobody liked comics Like nobody just fact Yet chose million other choices make big series create new member mcu already boring lame top didnt even adapt made something completely different than own comic changed everything character something worse show very predictably bombs people like show talking bout superhero fatique problem show bad jsut simple top just bad makes fans angry hundreds millions dollars greater part decade wasted something nobody wanted could used make something people would love So more than just show bad dont like actually deprived something would gladly pay wrong people charge changes will keep getting crap movies shows Even movies people end actually liking like fantastic still shaky ground still feels like someone touch humoring some variables target audience says important make kinds movies love movies succeed dont actually understand made so dancing edge failure people call good enough casuals might tired superheros huge audience ready eager more audience most disposable wealth spend such things Make fans want will give money doesnt get simpler than fans never wanted ironheart always going fail Even thread talking fantastic made nearly million bucks saying people dont want watch superhero movies more direct proof wrong whether movie considered financial success not million not nothing certainly justifies keep making more movies exactly going keep

"Yeah I think the big issue is it stopped feeling organic. I think they’d have been better off not jumping directly into a new saga and instead taking a path more like Gunn has with the DCU — make movies based on the best scripts you have, see what heroes and stories gain momentum, and build on them. From there they could figure out how to bring all of that together which would be when the new saga took shape.

My understanding is that is probably closer to how it worked the first time around. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen it mentioned a few times that even when they had the Thanos post credit scene after Avengers they still hadn’t actually decided on that as a direction, it was more just meant as a nod to fans and they eventually decided to roll with it (likely because it was so positively received).",Yeah think big issue stopped feeling organic think theyd better not jumping directly new saga instead taking path more like Gunn DCU make movies based best scripts see heroes stories gain momentum build could figure bring together would new saga took shape understanding probably closer worked first time around Im pretty sure Ive seen mentioned few times even Thanos post credit scene Avengers still hadnt actually decided direction more just meant nod fans eventually decided roll likely so positively received

So many people were confounded that Wanda was evil in Dr. Strange 2. So many people were uninterested in The Marvels because they didn't know who Monica Rambeau or Kamala Khan were. People didn't know who Elijah was in Captain America: Brave New World, which made that movie even harder to connect with. And what's going to happen when casual fans see Hulk's son show up in a movie? The idea of not knowing about these types of things certainly got some people to subscribe to D+ to stay in the loop, but they lost a lot of the casual movie fans over it. A lot of my friends and family really liked the MCU and we'd go see all of the movies together, but they didn't like it enough to subscribe to a whole new streaming service, and even if they did, they are busy and don't have time to watch a dozen new shows. 

And some of the shows were big enough flops that we'll probably never get follow-ups on stuff that should be really major. Like, Emilia Clarke's character from the Nick Fury show flew off at the end of the series with the powers of multiple avengers, including Captain Marvel's! She's a major force out there now, but we'll probably never see her again, and if we do, all the people who didn't watch the show are going to be completely baffled that there's a flying skrull with Groot powers.

I Know What You Did Last Summer opened in 6th down here and I'm still baffled about the reboot as it had one well regarded movie, one worse and one direct to video.

"Demon Slayer is insanely popular. Its manga sales are incredible as well and I think a large part is that it is relatively short. The manga finished in 2020, when the first movie was released. So if you got interested in it, you could just go get a completed series/series that was about to wrap up and you could experience the ending as it came out.

It sits just below Dragon Ball and Naruto in volume sales, with a fraction of the number of volumes. And sits comfortably ahead of other recent popular franchises like AOT, JJK, MHA. Those three+ demon slayer are the only manga started past 2010 (and I am being nice to AOT and including it as it is 2009) that are 100 million+ volumes sold club.

It’s hard to reconcile it with something like Wall-E when looking at what Pixar can do with an science fo theme. Everything about the alien emissaries and alien father plot is just so bland and boring. For the plot to even work they had to make every other character in space so incredibly stupid, like how do these creatures even survive on their own.


I hope Pixar can find what they lost along the way, I really do, even as recently as Onward they had a spark that’s just.. gone now. ",year old so ended seeing opening weekend doesent feel like Pixar movie feels like Sony movie not one more recent awesome fare hard reconcile something like WallE looking Pixar can science fo theme Everything alien emissaries alien father plot just so bland boring plot even work make every other character space so incredibly stupid like creatures even survive own hope Pixar can find lost along way really even recently Onward spark thats just gone now

"For  anyone who's actually interested in learning more about Galactus in the comics, here's a [gallery](https://imgur.com/a/HCgvvvp) of just a few examples from over the years, going all the way back to the first appearance arc and all the way to modern stuff. 

Galactus can be big enough to eat a planet like a cookie, but very rarely has been shown doing so. He's a cosmic abstract entity, the Devourer, a role in the Marvel cosmology that serves to help maintain the cosmic balance, and one that persists across the various incarnations of the Marvel multiverse (called Firmaments). 

Despite being able to appear however he wants, Galactus has been remarkably consistent across the years, typically ranging from a few dozen feet up to about 500-1000 on the high end. He uses a massive ship to process planets into food, but doesn't need it to do so, instead using it to purify and expedite the process. Why does he do this if he can also just become enormous and eat planets? Because comic book writers want him to, and they want him to do it that way 99.9% of the time. 

If you want a Watsonian explanation for it, just say it's incredibly inefficient for him to do so. Some writers have probably said as much at some point, but I can't be bothered to check.",anyone whos actually interested learning more Galactus comics heres gallery just few examples years going way back first appearance arc way modern stuff Galactus can big enough eat planet like cookie very rarely shown so Hes cosmic abstract entity Devourer role Marvel cosmology serves help maintain cosmic balance one persists across various incarnations Marvel multiverse called Firmaments Despite able appear however wants Galactus remarkably consistent across years typically ranging few dozen feet high end uses massive ship process planets food doesnt need so instead using purify expedite process can also just become enormous eat planets comic book writers want want way time want Watsonian explanation just say incredibly inefficient so Some writers probably said much some point cant bothered check

In Black Panther it comes across as a clooged-together mess of brilliant music and clever moments that don't work for each other very well, with him trying to explore a rich array of themes that he never really sticks the landing on. 

This time around he does it all with style.

"My best guess is that it's the multiplier based on the movie's opening weekend. So Sinners is a 1.00x since it's just the opening weekend. If a movie opened at $50m and currently has $100m, it'd say 2.00x",best guess multiplier based movies opening weekend So Sinners x since just opening weekend movie opened m currently m itd say x
"Multiplier based on the domestic opening weekend. Its a way to see how well the movie is doing over time as it make it easier to compare with other movies and make predictions based on genre and month of release. For example animation is know for having good legs (normally 3.3-3.5x multiplier) so King of Kings having a better multiplier than Amateur (action is normally 2.5x multiplier) is within expectation.

Its another way to compare the week by week drop which is also a way to predict where the movie will end

For extra context in general the box office is divided in domestic (US and Canada) and international (everybody else)* with the sum of the two being worldwide box office (WW in the graph).

The domestic is normally tracked like that due to the US being the biggest market* and due to, in general, hollywood being dominant force WW and domestic is important due to how much of it the studio actually gets (in the US about 50-60% stay with the studio, while international it is 40-50% on average, with China being an outlier giving 25% back to hollywood)

*This does not account for international movies well but the ones that actually make waves worldwide are few and between so they are looked individually instead of using generic rules. Also China may have a claim to be the biggest market, but it gives a worse return to studios (reason some big franchises uses chinese studio/companies as part of the project is to get better deal on their % - for example Transformers franchise) and not every movie is garanteed to have its way into it (they also give preference for local projects)",Multiplier based domestic opening weekend way see well movie time make easier compare other movies make predictions based genre month release example animation know good legs normally x multiplier so King Kings better multiplier than Amateur action normally x multiplier within expectation another way compare week week drop also way predict movie will end extra context general box office divided domestic US Canada international everybody else sum two worldwide box office WW graph domestic normally tracked like due US biggest market due general hollywood dominant force WW domestic important due much studio actually gets US stay studio international average China outlier giving back hollywood not account international movies well ones actually make waves worldwide few so looked individually instead using generic rules Also China may claim biggest market gives worse return studios reason some big franchises uses chinese studiocompanies part project get better deal example Transformers franchise not every movie garanteed way also give preference local projects

There’s been some hits too though with No Way Home, Shang-Chi, and most recently Deadpool and Wolverine, but so many disappointing or just plain bad movies (looking at you Eternals). 

I think the biggest problem though is the MCU is starting to collapse under the weight of itself. Theres so many characters now and so many storylines that have been started either in end credit scenes or within various movies, but none of them have seen so much as a 2nd visit. There’s so much MCU content between the TV shows and the movies that I’ve found myself watching some of it just so I can keep up with the story, then at the end of it questioning whether I actually enjoyed what I just watched (looking at you Secret Invasion). I understand the fatigue that people mention all the time, but for me the fatigue comes not from the quantity or frequency of content, but from how fragmented it’s all become. Maybe once we get to see all these new characters together in the next Avengers movie, that can right the ship as we’ll see everyone pulling in the same direction for the first time since Endgame. But at some point I think they need to find a way to retire some of these characters and shrink the MCU back down to a size where it’s more manageable.",Idk MCU needs return former glory even can Iron Man Endgame run might just lightning bottle cant repeated so much whats come challenging say least Theres some hits too though No Way Home ShangChi most recently Deadpool Wolverine so many disappointing just plain bad movies looking Eternals think biggest problem though MCU starting collapse weight Theres so many characters now so many storylines started either end credit scenes within various movies none seen so much nd visit Theres so much MCU content TV shows movies Ive found watching some just so can keep story end questioning whether actually enjoyed just watched looking Secret Invasion understand fatigue people mention time fatigue comes not quantity frequency content fragmented become Maybe get see new characters together next Avengers movie can right ship well see everyone pulling same direction first time since Endgame some point think need find way retire some characters shrink MCU back size more manageable

"I was never that much of a fan even of peak Marvel(which, unpopular opinion, included Infinity War but not Endgame which planted the seeds of this decline) but it's pretty clear that they are consistently making WORSE movies. Obviously there is the element of fatigue that would affect even good movies, but as much as I don't love the word, they just keep putting out **slop**.


This is a movie where a side character establishes himself as the successor of one of the most important characters of the universe, and is about him being dumped into a situation where he objectively does a pretty mediocre job both in terms of being a superhero and just being an intelligent action-thriller-semipolitical movie lead who can handle himself. Sam is pretty dumb and ineffective but thanks to the power of good feelings pulls through, through the means of joking/fake ""feels"" drama it's even pointed out in-universe, and it feels like even the movie seems to imply that OG Captain America would have fixed this whole thing in 3 minutes. You leave this movie and think that the new Captain America fucking sucks. 


On top of that, it's not a good movie that establishes otherwise interesting ideas that could have carried it, as the plot is convoluted and dumb, both of the villains are even worse than the main characters, and there isn't even the acting skills behind this movie. Anthony Mackie and checked out Harrison Ford is a downgrade from Chris Evans and Robert Redford, period. When you factor in that MCU movies of 2025 require knowledge of a terrible movie from 2008, a terrible movie you made recently but that no-one liked or wanted to think about, and an entire TV show(!!!!) to be enjoyed fully, and that all the flaws I've mentioned from the start of the post have applied consistently for too many marvel movies of the last few years, it's a miracle someone is even going.


>There’s been some hits too though with No Way Home, Shang-Chi, and most recently Deadpool and Wolverine


Idk if you are just saying three movies you liked(in which case I can only save Shang-Chi) but there are two hits, NWH and Deadpool and Wolverine(and GOTG 3 which is a masterpiece of the genre but Marvel is not in the business of making masterpieces), both of which let fans play with the mythology of characters they like without bothering with a story that they can judge.

Could you imagine telling Kenneth Branagh to make a movie with no finished script where each scene may change at any time and they might reshoot half of it anyway?

No casting, no shooting, just sitting on asses planning stories and writing outlines.

Sure, maybe Spider-Man Far From Home was already shot and ready to go - send that one out, but then it could have and should have been a full stop.  Allow people to miss it, give yourselves time to come back with something worth the wait.

But of course, that's all completely laughable and unrealistic in our modern world of short term profits at all costs.

Instead they doubled down on lots of new films and series that is overwhelming to keep up with, a bunch of characters that haven't always resonated with fans.

Since then we've had successes like No Way Home, Wakanda Forever and Guardians 3.

"Make it a small town issue across rural America during the Blip.

Over those 5 years you steadily have bigger towns progressively having mutants come into their powers during puberty. Town halls across rural America begin judging them for their differences until finally during the fight of the Eternals, the cosmic radiation ends up mass unlocking thousands of mutants' powers at once.

That's when you have Ross' Presidential successor believe mutants were sent here by aliens to take over their countries. Go for the deportation metaphor while going for the minority metaphor in modern day. With the US President and World Council believing they need to send mutants back out into space or some weird shit.

Then Captain America 5 can deal with Sam trying to fight for the rights of mutants in America while Xavier brings the X-Men together in the same movie to help Sam save the day in the climatic fight.

That's not to say that this most recent Cap movie was as high quality as the last.  It wasn't.  The actors all put in work and the action had fun bits, but the script was a weak point.  The bad guy's plot was pretty lame mostly because what was built up to be a twist got ruined by the first marketing push because no one at Disney had faith in the film.

"It really isn't.

 Even as a marvel and dc fan there's a lot of superior media out there across books, movies, streaming, and video games on top of family, friends, taking care of our animals and running a business with my wife. It's incredibly stupid to expect people with busy lives (aka most adults) to do homework to know what's going on in a movie. 

The biggest advantage of the MCU was that unlike comic books, you didn't need to read Thor issue 1 and Avengers issue 200 to understand why Peter was getting beat to death by Loki after Wolverine died in X-Men 40 (but not THAT X-men comic, the *other* when where Wolverine is hunting his clone introduced in Weapon X issue 2). You'd instead could just tune in for the latest movie for 2 hours or so every  5 or 6 month and be perfectly caught up. That isn't the case anymore, and it's ultimately led to messier story lines that trip on their feat. Multiverse of madness was made *before* they could even see wandavision and it really shows

"Either your standards are pretty high, you have a narrower scope of genres you enjoy, or your AMC doesn’t show enough interesting movies. I don’t feel like I’ve taken advantage enough of my subscription this year and this is what I’ve seen:

- One of Them Days
- Companion
- The Monkey
- Mickey 17
- Freaky Tales
- Parvulos: Children of the Apocalypse
- Sinners
- The Legend of Ochi
- Thunderbolts
- Drop
- Friendship
- Mission: Impossible 8
- Materialists
- The Life of Chuck
- 28 Years Later
- Eddington
- Superman
- Fantastic Four

"It's a classic death-spiral, unfortunately.

Imagine you're operating a business which offers a specific product to the general consumer marketplace (in this particular case it's movie theater seats, but the pattern applies to any obsolete product of a dying industry from horse-drawn carriages to typewriters to live music) which you must sell at a particular volume in order to cover your fixed overheads and remain profitable. For one reason or another you find that you're no longer selling at the required volume, so you have to increase prices (both for tickets and concessions) and/or lower the quality of the product (i.e. understaffed, poorly maintained theaters with less diverse offerings) to make up for the falling demand. Of course, increased prices and a poorer product just drives away customers even more, which forces you to further increase prices and cut costs, which further drives down demand...

And so on. A death spiral. Hollywood literally disrupted itself.

You are a young nerdy probably white male American.

And YES we absolutely are living in a bubble here. So what did you do that got outside that bubble? And also might present yourself as either a small child or parent or a small child NOT the above profile which isn't going to be caught dead at a kids movie.

Maybe its the space videos or old animation clips I watch tickling the algorithim or maybe I'm just dead obviously in my late 30s and thus of prime parenting years even though I myself am single with no kids.

"If you work in marketing then you should damn well high quality works have been failing to find audiences for decades. Well unless we are defining ""good"" purely in terms of quantity of money made in which case no it seems bad.

"Then perhaps my argument is being misconstrued as well. The original comment was about the trailer and marketing campaign for the movie. This is a movie with, again, a broad sort of central theme that's hard to distill into a quick reel, with three leads (Ejiofor, Hiddleston, and Pajak) who don't interact with each other at all because they are temporally displaced from one another. Like Pulp Fiction, it's a disjointed narrative that's difficult to summarize without giving the whole thing away, but unlike Pulp Fiction, it's quiet and peaceful, which also means there's fewer ""money shots"" for the trailer.

I also, you'll notice, didn't say the movie was pretentious and Pulp Fiction isn't. I said the audience for this film was pretentious which was meant to be a self-deprecating jab. Because, again, for everything that has been said about Pulp Fiction both by creator and critic, it has banal hooks of violence and gangs that moviegoers will flock to more than The Life of Chuck's hooks of white guys dancing and people crying in cars. 

My whole point was to say other than saying ""from Stephen King and Mike Flanagan and starring Tom Hiddleston"" I wasn't sure how else to advertise it.",perhaps argument misconstrued well original comment trailer marketing campaign movie movie broad sort central theme thats hard distill quick reel three leads Ejiofor Hiddleston Pajak dont interact each other temporally displaced one another Like Pulp Fiction disjointed narrative thats difficult summarize without giving whole thing away unlike Pulp Fiction quiet peaceful also means theres fewer money shots trailer also youll notice didnt say movie pretentious Pulp Fiction isnt said audience film pretentious meant selfdeprecating jab everything said Pulp Fiction creator critic banal hooks violence gangs moviegoers will flock more than Life Chucks hooks white guys dancing people crying cars whole point say other than saying Stephen King Mike Flanagan starring Tom Hiddleston wasnt sure else advertise

"In the Aussie market, Thunderbolts* opened to the same MCU Aussie opening weekend spot as Captain America: Brave New World did, being the 5th lowest opening MCU movie, above only the opening weekends of Shang-Chi (2021), The Incredible Hulk (2008), The Marvels (2023) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).  

But with the higher cinema score/word of mouth and post launch marketing campaign, I suspect it might leg out to a higher total than Brave New World did earlier this year. I'm really interested to see it's week 2 hold/drop.  

After gaining +54% last week, Sinners has another great hold only dropping 24% in the Aussie market, which is still more than it brought in opening weekend, and between Thunderbolts and Sinners, A Minecraft was finally knocked from top spot moving down to 3rd with a 73% drop in it's 5th week.

"I think theres a few factors at play here, but the one I'll focus on with this comment is where the MCU was at then compared to now. 

Then, they were using the most iconic and well known superheroes from the comics and bringing them to life. Iron Man, Spider-Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, etc. These are all extremely well established names, even outside of Marvel and into pop culture itself. 

Now, they're taking all of these marquee superheroes that everyone has heard of, and replacing them with niche heroes or those who only diehard comic fans may have even heard of. These are not household names. They're hoping all of these new characters pop off in the same way Guardians of the Galaxy did, and expecting every single one to be a hit with new audiences just like they we're. 

The difference is, they had Adamantium pillars in place called the Avengers to withstand a bomb if the GOTG failed. Now, those same pillars are completely gone or missing, and theyre hoping they can cobble together a bunch of cement and steel and hope that it can do the same job.

I don't think those fans who left will be back, unless they get some more of those Adamantium pillars back.

"This is a wild take. If people want to go to the movies and are upset at ticket prices, theaters that offer passes are a cost effective alternative.

At regal, they offer discounts, rewards, and passes to lessen concession prices to get people to buy concessions.

"Other moviegoers aren’t “subsidising my movie theater costs.” These passes are an economic principle called a loss leader, which means that while they may technically lose a portion of the admission cost, the collateral returns on concession sales and upcharges for premium formats/showings/etc outweighs the loss enough for it to be profitable. 

Theatres don’t make their money from seat sales; most of the ticket price goes to the studios. Cinemas survive on concession costs and the occasional limited-edition tie-in merch, which is why your popcorn costs $30. ",Other moviegoers arent subsidising movie theater costs passes economic principle called loss leader means may technically lose portion admission cost collateral returns concession sales upcharges premium formatsshowingsetc outweighs loss enough profitable Theatres dont make money seat sales most ticket price goes studios Cinemas survive concession costs occasional limitededition tiein merch popcorn costs

"I think GOTG performed well because fans were riding on a high due to the other Avengers movies. Had people thinking, ""I know who these other characters are and these movies are awesome, so maybe this one will be too if Marvel is taking the time to get behind it? I might have never heard of the GOTG, but I trust Marvel.""

So it boiled down to fans still having good faith in everything Marvel was doing and expecting great content no matter what it is. 

GOTG was a good film, but I feel at that time period, they could have done any film on any niche hero, and it would have also done gangbusters. I think if GOTG came out of the blue now in 2025, that would do similar numbers that all these other current Marvel films are doing. Barely breaking even if not at all. Since Marvel doesn't have that same level of prestige and must see quality like it used too.

"No, they weren't.

The only MCU billion dollar films are:

* The Avengers -- the original team up movie
* Iron Man 3 -- which was literally the next film after The Avengers starring by far the most popular character, has no team up features
* Age of Ultron -- another Avengers movie
* ~~Iron Man 4~~ ~~Avengers 3~~ ~~Avengers 2.5~~ Captain America: Civil War -- an Avengers film all but in name that gives the most popular MCU character way more time, story and interest than the ostensible title character, so obviously it's a team up movie
* Black Panther -- the only Domestic oriented MCU movie, reception is mixed between the best superhero film ever (critics) and middling^(1) (MCU fans), has no team up features
* Avengers: Infinity War -- another Avengers film
* Captain Marvel -- has no team up features, widely thought to have only grossed a billion because people thought it would be necessary to understand the next film which was
* Avengers: Endgame -- a team up movie (and briefly the highest grossing film ever)
* Spider-Man: Far From Home -- the film immediately preceding an Avengers movie, has no team up features
* Spider-Man: No Way Home -- a team up movie of a sort... I feel it would be more accurate to call this nostalgia driven cameo bait, however as the team up involves non-MCU characters, unless you count Doctor Strange
* Deadpool & Wolverine -- also nostalgia driven cameo bait

Now, yes, eleven movies is a lot of billion dollar films but there are 36 MCU movies so that's 11/36 = 30.56%. That's the same hit rate as Harry Potter, counting Philosopher's Stone's re-releases getting it over the line. This is not Jurassic Park which has 4/6 movies counting re-releases where most of the films have got over the line. It's only special movies and those surrounding them that have ever hit a billion. 

Even if you limited it to team up movies, Thunderbolts* isn't a team up film. None of the characters involved are headliners of their own film in the way the team up films are:

* Avengers
* Age of Ultron
* Civil War
* Thor: Ragnarok (and this is the only one that did not hit a billion)
* IW
* Endgame
* No Way Home (and as I said, I think there's something else going on with this one)
* Deadpool & Wolverine (see: NWH)

Hell, two of the main cast of Thunderbolts* characters had never actually been in a movie, although that's counting the one making their cinematic debut in the film.

The MCU's billion dollar hit rate for non-team up films is (11-7)/(36-8) = 14.29%. That's worse than the Fastchise (2/10)... hell, it's worse than the Fastchise counting Better Luck Tomorrow *and* Hobbs & Shaw (2/12 = 16.67%).

nb The Marvels gets even crazier when you look at it like this. The two MCU movies which came out after an Avengers movie that didn't hit 1 billion? Family friendly comedy superhero movies. Those two films failed to crack $700m with the Avengers boost. The Marvels is a family friendly comedy superhero movie which came out without the aid of an Avengers boost in a weak box office environment. It's a kind of movie people have never had any particular interest in seeing and, lo, they did not turn up. (And, no, the problem isn't Ant Man.. Shazam! is a great film but it made less than $400m.

"I think too what has not helped at all is the sheer amount of either poor or utterly mid content that’s been produced since endgame. So much of it too is reported as being great and then it simply isn’t, so that initial “oh this is so great” just isn’t believed as much. 

So much of the content produced now is borderline unwatchable because not everyone wants to sit there and applaud because “here’s a thing you know.” 

Marvel people will *always* go and watch marvel, even if it is terrible. The vast majority of people simply won’t. Too much content, not enough quality",think too not helped sheer amount either poor utterly mid content thats produced since endgame So much too reported great simply isnt so initial oh so great just isnt believed much So much content produced now borderline unwatchable not everyone wants sit applaud heres thing know Marvel people will always go watch marvel even terrible vast majority people simply wont Too much content not enough quality

"That's exactly the other issue. Marvels quality is way too hit or miss at this point and really it's far more miss. Whether it's the movies or TV show. Bad quality will always sink a franchise no matter how much the franchise might try to truly turn it around. 

That also is the other big issue where there is far too much material at this point that you have to watch to keep up with. Like the movies, it's not help but the shaky quality, and it's even worse as it's far easier to sit through a shitty 2 hour movie than an 8 hour plus show. It's been joked but it's honestly true but future generations are going to have to watch a lot of movies and shows just to keep up. This isn't like James Bond movies where they for most of the part don't have continuity (barring a occasional reference to On Her Majesty's Secert Service or the craig films) or are like the Godzilla franchise where they are all split up into a different series/timelines.",Thats exactly other issue Marvels quality way too hit miss point really far more miss Whether movies TV show Bad quality will always sink franchise no matter much franchise might try truly turn around also other big issue far too much material point watch keep Like movies not help shaky quality even worse far easier sit shitty hour movie than hour plus show joked honestly true future generations going watch lot movies shows just keep isnt like James Bond movies most part dont continuity barring occasional reference Majestys Secert Service craig films like Godzilla franchise split different seriestimelines

"Most sequels nowadays are so horrible.  Just crapped out by studios to make money or written by directors who are allowed to go unchecked when their best work was tempered by the thoughtful insight of others to reign in their insanity a bit.  I remember being so excited for the new Star Wars when Episode I came out.  What a crushing disappointment that debacle was.

Infinity War, Fury Road, and Blade Runner 2049 are the only greats in the past 20 years, and the latter two are more remakes than sequels.

New Transformers and TMNT?  Complete and utter dogshit compared to the original 1986 or 1990 movies.  Resident Evil has been crap from the beginning; not even the first one was good.

Batman, John Wick, and Matrix started good but went downhill very quickly (although many other seem to like the even-more-unrealistic and poorly-storied sequels).

Ugh, I'd rather just watch the original from the 80s on almost any sequel or remake.",Most sequels nowadays so horrible Just crapped studios make money written directors allowed go unchecked best work tempered thoughtful insight others reign insanity bit remember so excited new Star Wars Episode came crushing disappointment debacle Infinity War Fury Road Blade Runner only greats past years latter two more remakes than sequels New Transformers TMNT Complete utter dogshit compared original movies Resident Evil crap beginning not even first one good Batman John Wick Matrix started good went downhill very quickly although many other seem like evenmoreunrealistic poorlystoried sequels Ugh Id rather just watch original s almost sequel remake

They are a cash cow if they can get green light and what I see happening and the money from the music and remasters alone make it worth doing. I can see them doing a biopics of the boy band New Kids on the Block and it selling. Really they could just go back and see what was the most popular behind the music from VH1 and do a biopics with remasters and remixes of the songs to sell. But the rights before then put them in and make money all throughout. Most of the capital is going into streaming services building their libraries to be worth the 15-20 dollars a month.,trend matches Hollywood prestige box office musical biopics cash cow can get green light see happening money music remasters alone make worth can see biopics boy band New Kids Block selling Really could just go back see most popular behind music VH biopics remasters remixes songs sell rights put make money throughout Most capital going streaming services building libraries worth dollars month
