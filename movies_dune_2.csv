"*Dune* as a whole - source material included - is **not** character-driven in any way, shape, or form, and is decidedly detached and unemotional. It's deliberate. There are multiple instances across the books where a character witnesses something that should be deeply traumatizing and thinks ""Huh, it's probably a bad sign that I didn't have much of a reaction to that.""

"The movie makes no sense without the Spacing Guild which runs the galactic economy via folding space using the spice. It is the whole point of why the spice is valuable.

It's a movie about nothing without the Spacing Guild.

I gave Part 1 a pass figuring of course we are introduced to the Spacing Guild in Part 2.

Since Alia is never born in Villeneuve's story, Part 2 takes place in less than 9 months.

The whole movie is a total miss.  For those who have not read the book it makes no sense. For those who have read the book Villeneuve's Dune is some other story.

1. The Southern hemisphere is unviewable because the Fremen pay the Spacing Guild to keep the outer world blind.
2. The Harkonnen did not find the Sietches for the same reason.
3. Raban is killed by the emperor because the spice flow has stopped.
4. Alia is born and is about five years old when the climax comes and it is she who killed Vladimir Harkonnen.  
5. The Landsraad is sent back by the Spacing Guild who control who travels where in space.

It goes on and on.

Villeneuve think's he's creating his own ""Lord of the Rings"" with an obvious Part 3 coming to recover Chani from the desert, for Feyd's child to challenge for the throne, for the 5 years gestating Alia to be born.",movie makes no sense without Spacing Guild runs galactic economy via folding space using spice whole point spice valuable movie nothing without Spacing Guild gave Part pass figuring course introduced Spacing Guild Part Since Alia never born Villeneuves story Part takes place less than months whole movie total miss not read book makes no sense read book Villeneuves Dune some other story Southern hemisphere unviewable Fremen pay Spacing Guild keep outer world blind Harkonnen not find Sietches same reason Raban killed emperor spice flow stopped Alia born five years old climax comes killed Vladimir Harkonnen Landsraad sent back Spacing Guild control travels space goes Villeneuve thinks hes creating own Lord Rings obvious Part coming recover Chani desert Feyds child challenge throne years gestating Alia born,Negative

Then I watched the movie again, having forgotten exactly how it went, with a friend who had done the same and we were roasting the movie the whole time.

The characters in the book are SO SO much deeper and the political intrigue is so much more interesting. The acting too was honestly so monotonous and so weird! Like why is Paul so constantly unsure of himself and talking like he's constantly on drugs and slurring his words half the time? It's hard not to compare that to the classy, royal, highly intelligent book Paul!!

We both honestly got so bored we almost slept until Paul and Jessica saw the sandworm. We both admit though that adopting all that complexity of the books into even a 3 hour movie is really difficult. I don't know where you'd start. At least the visuals and sound were there.

"I don't know, both in book and in the movie there's plenty of emotions (since thzt seem to be your biggest gripe).

It's not overflowing, they're realistic in a sense and that's what makes it work so well IMO.

Leto is clearly shown to love and care for Jessica (especially in the book, as the part of the book where this is the most important and apparent has been removed from the movie).

Paul is clearly conflicted about his mother and his destiny, and later in the story is clearly curious about the fremen and truly in love with Chain (sticking with the first books here, because his relationship with fremens evolve quite a bit)

Maybe the most obvious would be the Duke's hate of the Atreides and love of Arrakis (and yes to me it's portrayed as him loving the planet itself, sure it's for what it brings to him but still) as well as... Some awful depictions of some of his feelings because Herbert was deeply homophobic.

I could go one with most characters, but the thing is that most of these feelings are shown in a normal manner, with some explosions but mainly with subtlety (or at least the same subtlety we'd have in real life)",dont know book movie theres plenty emotions since thzt seem biggest gripe not overflowing theyre realistic sense thats makes work so well IMO Leto clearly shown love care Jessica especially book part book most important apparent removed movie Paul clearly conflicted mother destiny later story clearly curious fremen truly love Chain sticking first books relationship fremens evolve quite bit Maybe most obvious would Dukes hate Atreides love Arrakis yes portrayed loving planet sure brings still well Some awful depictions some feelings Herbert deeply homophobic could go one most characters thing most feelings shown normal manner some explosions mainly subtlety least same subtlety wed real life,Positive

"I’d have to wholeheartedly disagree with your take here. 

I usually stay away from science fiction. I avoid it, in fact. I liked Star Wars when I was 10-12 years old, and I thought I’d grown out of the genre. So when Dune came around and everyone raved about it, I thought it was a bunch of nerds hyped up about the next Lord of the Rings. No thanks.

Well, Dune II came out and people from various unconnected social circles in my life all talked about how awesome it was. And one person I highly respect recommended that I watch it. So I caved.

But I knew how these fuckin movies work. They have intricate made-up universes with various races, planets, politics and plotlines going on, so I did my homework and researched to the extent I could while limiting spoilers. 

And then I finally watched Dune I. I agree—the cinematography, CGI, soundtrack were amazing. However, I disagree with you not caring about the characters. Maybe if I watched the movie without having done my research I’d feel differently, but I warmed up to Paul rather quickly, and I liked Lego’s relationship with him as a caring father. I was unsure about Lady Jessica at first. And then Duncan Idaho, Gurney, and the rest. I was in.

And after having just settled into Arrakis, they get pretty much annihilated by the Harkonnen. All of the characters I had just worked up to—gone. And Paul and Jessica just could not catch a fucking break. It felt like the world was ending for them and I actually felt bad and worried for them. 

This is coming from someone who usually doesn’t like these types of movies. It’s because they’re usually corny and too unrealistic. Not this movie—they set the bar for how it should be done.

So I actually liked the movie. Sorry you didn’t, I guess.",Id wholeheartedly disagree take usually stay away science fiction avoid fact liked Star Wars years old thought Id grown genre So Dune came around everyone raved thought bunch nerds hyped next Lord Rings No thanks Well Dune II came people various unconnected social circles life talked awesome one person highly respect recommended watch So caved knew fuckin movies work intricate madeup universes various races planets politics plotlines going so homework researched extent could limiting spoilers finally watched Dune agreethe cinematography CGI soundtrack amazing However disagree not caring characters Maybe watched movie without done research Id feel differently warmed Paul rather quickly liked Legos relationship caring father unsure Lady Jessica first Duncan Idaho Gurney rest just settled Arrakis get pretty much annihilated Harkonnen characters just worked togone Paul Jessica just could not catch fucking break felt like world ending actually felt bad worried coming someone usually doesnt like types movies theyre usually corny too unrealistic Not moviethey set bar should done So actually liked movie Sorry didnt guess,Positive

"I absolutely loved the movie, I do agree with that last part though, it's as if they made a 1980s Dune movie reboot, rather than a book adaptation. I found it odd that every video adaptation (movies and tv show), have chosen to basically ""storyboard"" them almost exactly the same way. 

However, I did enjoy part 1 very much, I think the character development was focused mainly on introduction, and world building because they were all going to die in the next 45 mins. Knowing you're going to make a trilogy it would make sense to mainly focus on the characters that'll be returning. After watching part 2 I think it really elevated the first one, I won't speak on pt2 yet, I just finished watching it literally 10 mins ago, and would need time to really process it.

The books were good for what they are, they're more like a Bethesda game vs Boulders gate or something lol. I'd love to get an entire book, or movie about the space travels, and their relationship with the spice.

"It was probably one of the most dull sci fi movies I've ever seen. Caveat to this is that I don't at all enjoy Denis's sci fi but I love all of his other stuff. Arrival was probably one of the best short stories I've read, Denis goes minimal and brutalist in most of his films so through that lens it would be hard to mess up. But I said above that the through lines felt either random or non existent outside of blue red shield team death matches. It was also very hard to get the sense of where the movie was driving the action, like soldiers drop out of the sky into buildings with no other goal than to kill the others, and I have no sense of where everyone is in relation to each other because Denis just drops these guys in a building that I had no functional introduction to. It was very hard to pick out who was who and why they were fighting or there was no scene by scene desire outside of kill who's in front of you. A comparison to this is the end of Rogue One where the entire movie is predicated on death star plans, and there is a several tier obsticle course at the end, with a shielded planet, a large communications dish, emotional threads connecting the characters to one another beyond we fight for x, y or z side, and plausible steps to bring down the shield and capture the plans. In dune, it's just people fighting from one scene to the next, there is no real qualifier for each scene beyond the poisoin tooth, the ""use your voice"" stuff, and perhaps the right of passage fight at the end (if you bought into Timothy's physicality in the movie), and those scenes are like 15 min at most in a 2 and a half hour movie.",probably one most dull sci fi movies Ive ever seen Caveat dont enjoy Deniss sci fi love other stuff Arrival probably one best short stories Ive read Denis goes minimal brutalist most films so lens would hard mess said lines felt either random non existent outside blue red shield team death matches also very hard get sense movie driving action like soldiers drop sky buildings no other goal than kill others no sense everyone relation each other Denis just drops guys building no functional introduction very hard pick fighting no scene scene desire outside kill whos front comparison end Rogue One entire movie predicated death star plans several tier obsticle course end shielded planet large communications dish emotional threads connecting characters one another beyond fight x y z side plausible steps bring shield capture plans dune just people fighting one scene next no real qualifier each scene beyond poisoin tooth use voice stuff perhaps right passage fight end bought Timothys physicality movie scenes like min most half hour movie,Positive

Political dramas are completely focused on who the characters are and why they want what they want. Eg, *The Ides of March, Game of Thrones, House of Cards.* Their plots are compelling because the characters are fleshed out—they're not necessarily likeable, but are understandable.

Which is exactly why Dune the novel is compelling. There are layers of intrigue built around manipulation, who can trust who, what characters harbor hidden motivations and why, characters that feel divided in their loyalty, the goals of different political factions and how they align and conflict, and so on. More broadly, the novel is largely a character study of Paul and how being the ""chosen one"" changes him.

"I actually think that movies are a much more forgiving medium (probably because I'm not a cinephile and so don't notice anything beyond what your average film-goer notices when it comes to cinematography, sound, acting, etc.....but I'm really into literature and need exceptional prose to love a book), so basically any book where I like the idea but don't love the execution seems like prime movie material. 

This is actually one of the reasons I was excited for this movie in particular: I thought a good director could fix a lot of the problems with the book. 

To answer your question, I think *Arrival* far surpasses the short story that inspired it. I liked *The Martian* much more as a movie, and expect the adaptation of Weir's other novel, *Project Hail Mary*, to be better than the book (which was at times a painful reading experience). *Good Morning Midnight* was an okay movie and a terrible book. I loved *The Queen's Gambit* as a TV show but couldn't make it past the first chapter in the novel. (There are probably others but those are all that come to mind right now.....)

The theme in question is basically ""what makes a living being ?"", the movie is really centred around humans, sentience and feelings while the book also integrates animals and beliefs into the mix, one isn't better than the other it's just a question of focus vs generality, and as such I think that the two are basically complementary",Bladerunner didnt like book nor movie movie better someone loves Ill put caveat book movie explore same themes different ways different degrees movie literally removed part book gave title though least didnt keep said title so props theme question basically makes living movie really centred around humans sentience feelings book also integrates animals beliefs mix one isnt better than other just question focus vs generality such think two basically complementary,Positive

"I had a reddit account for ten years. I'm not sure if it gave me much benefit in my life - I learnt some new facts, I watched a lot of NBA/football highlights which gave me things to talk to my co-workers about and I think that might be it for benefits. 

On the facts part, maybe I should just call it trivia - a lot of it is quite inconsequential to life. Did you know Steve Buscemi actually broke his toe kicking the helmet while filming LOTR? Or something like that. It doesn't matter too much. I'll find comfort in the fact that I'm not really missing out on much - some bullshit trivia that another redditor at a party can tell me one day. I'll try to deepen my knowledge in things I'm passionate about instead.

I watched a lot of dumb videos and made a lot of dumb comments, participated in lowering my own and other's self-esteem (intentional or not, this app can be soul-crushing at times), I wasted a lotttt of time endlessly scrolling hoping to get a dopamine rush and I got complacent with using that app instead of learning new skills or attempting to engage with more notable content. I wish I could get the time back, but mourning it wont help. I want to get the dopamine receptors back on track though, that should be possible. 

So I've decided to delete my account, and I've decided to edit my posts/comments in a protest of some sort against what reddit has represented in my life and against reddit itself. That's not to say that I think reddit is inherently bad, I'm sure there are many people out there who are getting benefits from this app - I am not one of them though and so after ten years, my time is at an end.

Special shoutout to my favorite sub AskHistorians, that is THE exemplar subreddit - I will most likely visit that one without an account, as well as a few others (the aforementioned sports ones, and some special interests I have like podcasts or gaming) but hopefully in more of a 2010s internet style - there for a browse every now again, but not a massive romp every second my eyes don't need to be anywhere else. 

I've used something called PowerDeleteSuite to replace all my original submissions with this message instead - maybe what I've said is wanky or boring but I think I'm okay with that. I think I'm okay with a lot of things about myself, and I don't think reddit is necessarily the best place for me to celebrating that mindset. 

I've said for awhile that I would delete, I think maybe two or three years. It's 1:30am and I'm finally getting around to do it. I'm so damn tired, but I'm worried if I don't do it now then it'll be another two or three years.

"The rule makes sense, and isn't the end all be all of what movies can do. A sequel very well can and should reuse music.... but if a score has already been awarded then it doesn't need another award. That doesn't mean the music is no longer great or that the academy thinks it any less deserving. It just means it's already been recognized. 

If filmmakers/composers want to rework a score just to meet some awards criteria then that's their perogative, not the academy's. The academy isn't god and movies will still reuse scores in sequels. At the end of the day filmmakers should make decisions that result in good movies, not awards.

And, ultimately I think 20% is still a wide margin that composers can still reuse a lot of material and use certain leitmotifs for the sake of thematic cohesion while still meeting academy eligibility. Is the number kind of arbitrary?

"An astronaut talks about relating heavily to that scene, having done something so life changing and everyone's more excited about the guy with the big pumpkin.

Part of my statement on that was it was a much more relatable form of coping with war to soldiers by the 2000s. I want to note the films were all completed before the towers fell, but it tracks in a contemporary sense (like desert storm, Falklands, etc) compared to Tolkien's time.

Edit: to expand, the war they experienced abroad did not touch their home country in the same way. While, again, Tolkien denies this was anything but a bit of fantasy, it's not hard to look at the Scouring of the Shire as a major social critique. I think a version that omits that for the characters feeling distant and out of place with their surroundings is very valid for the time it came out in, and the experiences veterans then had (I can elaborate, but I grew up with veterans and servicemen so I don't know what's apparent). One of the seeds for the paper was my uncle seeing the clip of the astronaut talking about the big pumpkin and going, ""yep, exactly like that.""

>DUNE: PART TWO

>The saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast. The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”

>The big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).

>""Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.

The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.

>Villeneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West.

Like actually on the level of James Joyce written well, And James Joyce could make you feel the leaden weight of snowflakes just by writing about them really well. 

But there's a little more here. So, *Dune* is obsessed with time. Memory and history are literally joined. And just like memory, history gets a lot of it wrong. And he can see it. He can see all the lies that came before and many of the ones to come. And he can't change any of it, because all the alternative paths are worse. Much, much worse.

So Paul, who loves Chani, has to go and marry Irulan. Want doesn't even come into it, he has no choice if any of this was going to mean anything. Chani is frustrated, and Paul tells her that the name won't matter. He will never touch Irulan. He can see the future, it is both promise and prophesy.

And the last line is Jessica putting the scale of the thing he just did in perspective. The books are recordings in-world written by Irulan, and even Irulan recognizes Chani's status as wife in all but name. The lie is that he married Irulan, which he does in public and in a legally binding sense. The truth is that every part of him that means anything belongs to her, and will forever.

"Spoilers ahead. That said, pretty much the entire plot of *Dune* is spoiled in the first chapter.

Eh, not really. Leto II sees the same Golden Path that Paul sees. Paul's problem is that he isn't the cause of the Jihad, he's just the catalyst that sets it off. It had been brewing for ten thousand years because humanity's expansion and mixing had been stifled by the machinations of the Imperium, the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, etc. 

That subconscious need to mingle our genes and leave our homes built up across the Imperium but was felt most strongly by the Fremen who were so oppressed by the Harkonnens. Additionally, the Bene Gesserit planting the myth of the messiah for them to use later gave a direction for all that energy to go. 

That's why Paul sees that he can't stop the Jihad no matter how hard he tried, even if he walked into the desert to die. It was never within his power to stop. And as Leto II pontificates endlessly (whenever he isn't telling Moneo about his lack of a gross protuberance), trying to contain and quash humanity would have led to an even worse disaster that would have completely wiped out all of humanity.

Paul failed because he's wasn't willing to be *brutal enough* to follow the Golden Path. And also he was unwilling to become a giant gross worm monster possessed by the collective memory of all of his ancestors.",Spoilers ahead said pretty much entire plot Dune spoiled first chapter Eh not really Leto II sees same Golden Path Paul sees Pauls problem isnt cause Jihad hes just catalyst sets brewing ten thousand years humanitys expansion mixing stifled machinations Imperium Bene Gesserit Spacing Guild etc subconscious need mingle genes leave homes built across Imperium felt most strongly Fremen so oppressed Harkonnens Additionally Bene Gesserit planting myth messiah use later gave direction energy go Thats Paul sees cant stop Jihad no matter hard tried even walked desert die never within power stop Leto II pontificates endlessly whenever isnt telling Moneo lack gross protuberance trying contain quash humanity would led even worse disaster would completely wiped humanity Paul failed hes wasnt willing brutal enough follow Golden Path also unwilling become giant gross worm monster possessed collective memory ancestors,Positive

Similarly, you can't rise against the government when you can't physically get to them because you can't fly your own ships and the only people who can fly them aren't going to help you destabilize their paycheck.

To the second point, the Atreides army can *almost* go toe to toe with Sardaukar and the Fremen can wipe them out, but no one else even comes close. So assuming you ever did make it to the Emperor's door, you can't stand up to the Sardaukar and you can't turn them to your side, either.

The Fellowship of the Ring won an Oscar for Best Original Score.

The Two Towers was *not even nominated* for that same award because it contained some themes from the first movie. *Any* re-use was supposed to be disallowed under the then current academy rule. However, this snub lead to enough of an outcry that the rule was modified to the 20% rule, though not in time to allow The Two Towers a nomination. 

However, the change did allow in order to allow The Return of the King to be nominated, which then went on to win another Oscar for best original score.

So, falling afoul of the 20% rule is falling afoul of a rule that was already changed to allow sequels to re-use themes as long as *enough* of the score for the second movie is original.

That said, there could be arguments to what is original vs not, if a theme is being ""re-used.""

But it did rub me up the wrong way with Han, because in my head 'Han and the Princess' was always Han's theme  and what came to mind when I thought of the character - so for Williams to come back and give Han a pretty run of the mill generic adventure theme (That suits Solo but doesn't suit Harrison Ford's Han in my opinion) just felt like Lucasfilm getting Williams involved purely for the sake of getting some headlines and having his name on the poster.

"I've understood the Old Duke as a matador for 20+ years my dude.

And since I lack Bene Gesserit precision I could not quite recall if this was explicit but checking he is explicitly described as a matador with a magenta cape. This is on page 67 of my edition between Jessica speaking with Leto and meeting Shadout Mapes for the first time. 

Actually this might make a nice bit of encapsulation for why I don't care for Villeneuve's actual choices. Herbert gives us a matador Duke a grand and theatrical gesture that's maybe very small but very in keeping with Dune's role as the Anti Sci-fi. The future is not the future, but the past come again in all its aristocratic grandeur, decadence, and (going over to the Baron) deeply human corruption. 

I see only faint traces of that in Villeneuve's movies. The Atreides are stark, stoic, and morose military men, with frankly a look that says fascism to me more then anything else. Not for nothing given the ""both sides are bad, imperialism bad"" undertones underwriting Paul and Chani's little spat. And to keep the Harkonnen's worse they go from corrupt and decadent to... monstrous baldies that shop at the H.R. Giger store.

"Almost every single movie composer working today has what are called “additional writers” or “composer’s assistants”, who are frequently uncredited.

This is as true for composers of major blockbuster films, as it is for composers who work on small indie productions. It is standard practice in the film and TV scoring industry. This is how modern film and TV production works.

You can get a detailed explanation and industry insights from this working composer, with some commentary about the controversy of this practice within the industry:

https://youtu.be/Gn7ihBrWKyE

Here’s another composer’s explanation of it (skip ahead to 2:18):

https://youtu.be/jOkoptwKx_s

Bottom line is this — a lot of people who don’t know how the industry works constantly post this information about Hans Zimmer’s assistants as if he’s somehow the bad guy, or is lazy, or untalented, etc. But he is actually one of the first to talk very publicly about it, so much so that he often brings attention to the actual assistants that work for him, helps them get their own gigs, and supports them in their own personal careers, so a lot of composers who worked for him are now well-known in their own right.

So the real truth is that while the practice is definitely not without controversy, it is in fact STANDARD practice in the industry, and of all the people involved Hans Zimmer has been the one guy who publicly championed his own assistants and helps them establish their own successful careers.",Almost every single movie composer working today called additional writers composers assistants frequently uncredited true composers major blockbuster films composers work small indie productions standard practice film TV scoring industry modern film TV production works can get detailed explanation industry insights working composer some commentary controversy practice within industry Heres another composers explanation skip ahead Bottom line lot people dont know industry works constantly post information Hans Zimmers assistants hes somehow bad guy lazy untalented etc actually one first talk very publicly so much so often brings attention actual assistants work helps get own gigs supports own personal careers so lot composers worked now wellknown own right So real truth practice definitely not without controversy fact STANDARD practice industry people involved Hans Zimmer one guy publicly championed own assistants helps establish own successful careers,Positive

But the mainstream marketing was very vague at best about it. 

You can thank the Divergent series for that one. Their adaptation of the third book was split into two parts, and the first part bombed so hard they never made a second.

"I liked Villeneuve's version a great deal, but I've read the books multiple times and seen both Lynch's Dune and the miniseries.  They all have their strengths and weaknesses.

I think I like Villeneuve's version the best, but there are definitely some parts I liked better in the other two renditions.  There were areas that might have been improved, hard though choices always are, and I'm just sitting in my armchair critiquing, so take this with a grain of salt.

For example, it was a deviation from the books, but I liked the way the miniseries dinner scene and other scenes included more of Princess Irulan and had her actually doing things rather than merely showing up at the very end as a minor plot point.  It fit well with the fact that she was Bene Gesserit trained and made her a more interesting character.  It was also a nice contrast with Paul, they both being young people trying to come to terms with the strict political roles that they had to play for the sake of their families.  I think that aspect came across well in Villeneuve's version with the conversation between Leto and Paul, but having the contrast with someone Paul's age was a nice embellishment.

Then there's the fact the dinner scene was entirely cut from Villeneuve's version.  I still don't get that, even though they filmed it.  It's a really key ""setting the stage"" scene for Arrakis and the Atreides.  Some of the characters were barely fleshed out (Hawat, Yueh, Kynes only partly).  They cut most of the suspicion thrown upon Jessica and the worry about spies in the Atreides.  There were other parts of the film that were more dragged out.  They could have trimmed some of those and fit more interesting stuff in.  The choices were a bit weird.  As has been noted by many people, the sound mixing was bizarre sometimes.

There were many things that were well done.  The ornithopters were absolutely awesome.

I really liked the film, but I can see why people wouldn't be as enthusiastic.",liked Villeneuves version great deal Ive read books multiple times seen Lynchs Dune miniseries strengths weaknesses think like Villeneuves version best definitely some parts liked better other two renditions areas might improved hard though choices always Im just sitting armchair critiquing so take grain salt example deviation books liked way miniseries dinner scene other scenes included more Princess Irulan actually things rather than merely showing very end minor plot point fit well fact Bene Gesserit trained made more interesting character also nice contrast Paul young people trying come terms strict political roles play sake families think aspect came across well Villeneuves version conversation Leto Paul contrast someone Pauls age nice embellishment theres fact dinner scene entirely cut Villeneuves version still dont get even though filmed really key setting stage scene Arrakis Atreides Some characters barely fleshed Hawat Yueh Kynes only partly cut most suspicion thrown upon Jessica worry spies Atreides other parts film more dragged could trimmed some fit more interesting stuff choices bit weird noted many people sound mixing bizarre sometimes many things well done ornithopters absolutely awesome really liked film can see people wouldnt enthusiastic,Positive

I actually went back and watched other Denis movies. A lot of his movies have something I can't align with personally, they just feel a little emotionally empty at times.

The navigators that guide the spaceships in faster than light travel are all absolutely high as a kite on spice to let them see where they're are traveling. Think about it, if you're traveling faster than light, how would you see where you're going? Dune was written during the oil crisis in the 60s, spice is basically the oil of Dune. Without it, space travel is not possible. The way they travel faster than light is related to those shields they use. That's basically all the futuristic tech the book makes up.

All this is because the machine/AI war already happened in the Dune universe thousands of years ago before the first book.

This is what got him & his family killed.

The Baron then comments about how he see using Dune the same way and later realizes just how close he came to getting his entire House ganked.

"I don't think it normalizes it at all. I feel like it was a really well made exploration of whether being the greatest is worth what it can take.

Story time:

I decided to pursue a career in something that had a huge amount of competition. I was told in university that 5% of us would be good enough to make it, and only 2% would have what it takes to still be doing it 5 years later. My first mentor was VERY hard on me. The first time I showed him what I could do (having been used to excelling among my peers up to that point) he tore me apart so badly that it took me a full year to get the courage to try again. I thought my career was over initially and that was the end, I was another failure to prove the stats. I literally took everything I'd done up to that point and started again. I killed myself for a full year because of the humiliation of knowing I had completely failed to impress on any level, in fact the disappointment and disdain for what I could do was palpable.

The next time around was a similar experience if truth be told. But with a few pieces that he didn't completely hate. He started to test me, to push me. Critiquing me hard and not accepting any excuses. A year after that he offered me a job with a huge pay increase to join his small elite team.

It's been over 10 years since then and I'm still going strong. We remain friends to this day. I owe him so much that I'll never be able to repay.

Mediocrity can sometimes be a curse. The curse that resigns potentially great people to never meet that potential. I think Whiplash is just a deeply personal essay on whether success is worth pursuing by any means necessary, or whether there's a line that shouldn't be crossed. The ending to me is ambiguous. Fletcher clearly is unhinged and spiteful, not to be celebrated. But he created a genius. The best. I think it just leaves it up to the viewer to decide for Andrew if that success was worth the abuse or whether he would have preferred to potentially wallow in mediocrity.

I'm glad I got the treatment I did. It made me who I am. But I couldn't ever do that to someone else. Which may be a good thing or may not.",dont think normalizes feel like really well made exploration whether greatest worth can take Story time decided pursue career something huge amount competition told university us would good enough make only would takes still years later first mentor VERY hard first time showed could used excelling among peers point tore apart so badly took full year get courage try thought career initially end another failure prove stats literally took everything Id done point started killed full year humiliation knowing completely failed impress level fact disappointment disdain could palpable next time around similar experience truth told few pieces didnt completely hate started test push Critiquing hard not accepting excuses year offered job huge pay increase join small elite team years since Im still going strong remain friends day owe so much Ill never able repay Mediocrity can sometimes curse curse resigns potentially great people never meet potential think Whiplash just deeply personal essay whether success worth pursuing means necessary whether theres line shouldnt crossed ending ambiguous Fletcher clearly unhinged spiteful not celebrated created genius best think just leaves viewer decide Andrew success worth abuse whether would preferred potentially wallow mediocrity Im glad got treatment made couldnt ever someone else may good thing may not,Positive

">I was so looking forward to it too. And it just sucked.

Yeesh, it sounds like you went into it wanting to hate it. 

Like, one of the songs had a weird part (played when the Bene Gesserit ship was leaving Caladan), but the soundtrack overall was pretty dope. Sure, it's not gonna revolutionize movie soundtracks like Inception, but who cares?

The desert colors were pretty and the building shapes I thought were really unique and cool. The ships were also awesome, with the angular designs of the Atreides and the large beetle-like designs of the Harkonnens. 

The characters were a bit muted, but Leto & Gurney were cool, I would have liked more screen time with Hawat, and Duncan Idaho was awesome. I liked all the Fremen and want to see more into the portrayal of their society.

The blood ritual on Salusa Secundus, the Harkonnen invasion scene, the fight scenes in the tunnels, the glimpses of heighliners in orbit, and all the sandworm scenes, were fucking awesome.

If you go into it knowing it's ""Part 1"", with a ""Part 2"" following close behind, I think it's a lot harder to make fair and reasonable criticisms of the plot. 

Sure, it wasn't perfect. I really missed the dinner party scene, and I'm bummed they didn't include Feyd or Count and Lady Fenring, but I think you really have to go out of your way to say ""it just sucked"".",so looking forward too just sucked Yeesh sounds like went wanting hate Like one songs weird part played Bene Gesserit ship leaving Caladan soundtrack overall pretty dope Sure not gonna revolutionize movie soundtracks like Inception cares desert colors pretty building shapes thought really unique cool ships also awesome angular designs Atreides large beetlelike designs Harkonnens characters bit muted Leto Gurney cool would liked more screen time Hawat Duncan Idaho awesome liked Fremen want see more portrayal society blood ritual Salusa Secundus Harkonnen invasion scene fight scenes tunnels glimpses heighliners orbit sandworm scenes fucking awesome go knowing Part Part following close behind think lot harder make fair reasonable criticisms plot Sure wasnt perfect really missed dinner party scene Im bummed didnt include Feyd Count Lady Fenring think really go way say just sucked,Positive
"Well, it sounds like your main issue is with the source material, not the movie per se. 

Dune is considered by many to be the greatest science fiction book of all time. Google will give you many, many opinions on why it’s so great. Personally, I love the world building. 

I think one problem is that many people forget it was written well over a sixty years ago. If I were to watch the LOTR movies, without knowing its origin, I’d say it was beautifully filmed but the story was a run-if-the-mill fantastical hero’s journey. However, what I would be missing is that, in many ways, the reason LOTR seems so cliche is because it was so influential. Dune is the same. It doesn’t seem special because so many stories and shows and movies have been influenced by it, making it seem “average.”

It, however, like LOTR, popularized what was to follow.",Well sounds like main issue source material not movie per se Dune considered many greatest science fiction book time Google will give many many opinions so great Personally love world building think one problem many people forget written well sixty years ago watch LOTR movies without knowing origin Id say beautifully filmed story runifthemill fantastical heros journey However would missing many ways reason LOTR seems so cliche so influential Dune same doesnt seem special so many stories shows movies influenced making seem average however like LOTR popularized follow,Positive

"As a huge fan of the book, I gotta disagree. I love near every second of what we got in Part I, but it’s still missing so much of the heart and soul of the novel.

But while these scenes aren’t integral to the plot, per se, they are absolutely crucial in fleshing out the world and the characters. 

In the film, all nuance is gone from the Atreides household. Duncan isn’t conflicted and flawed and suspicious. Jessica isn’t fighting a battle on all fronts and desperately trying to protect a husband she’s loved but will lose. Gurney isn’t even a warrior-troubadour, playing music and dispensing wisdoms through quotation. Instead, they’re all flatly who they are.

"I agree. As a fan of both the book and Villeneuve’s previous movies I really, really enjoyed it as a film but as a Dune adaptation I think it fell short.

I think it could have easily done a much better job of setting the stage.

"Yeah, as someone who didn't read the book, I found myself not caring about any of the characters.

"I'm so glad someone else said it! I was really shocked with how much they left out of the movie, especially when they're already splitting it into two parts. Some things left out are smaller than others, but leaving out things like Gurney playing his ballaset, the interactions of the Atreides house on dune, and more, made this adaptation feel almost soulless in my opinion.",Im so glad someone else said really shocked much left movie especially theyre already splitting two parts Some things left smaller than others leaving things like Gurney playing ballaset interactions Atreides house dune more made adaptation feel almost soulless opinion,Positive
"Having not read the book, I agree. 

It was super well done, but it lacked character development. I know they had limited time to cram everything in, but they should've at least built up an emotional connection to Duke Leto.  Show him saving a village, or saving a life so his death scene is much more impactful. 

Not sure if those are things he would've done in the book, but point is I feel like the audience didn't have much reason to care about his death, as well shot as it was.",not read book agree super well done lacked character development know limited time cram everything shouldve least built emotional connection Duke Leto Show saving village saving life so death scene much more impactful Not sure things wouldve done book point feel like audience didnt much reason care death well shot,Positive
I agree. I think they could have easily added 20 minutes more footage of all the scenes they cut out that we know about plus more that we don't know about.

As someone who really likes the books, I think we could see a lot more come to life in the films if Denis gets to finish this out.

"> calls it boring and thinks nothing happens

As someone who shares that other posters view, a big part of why I agree with your SO is _because_ they cut out stuff like the politics and subterfuge. The film felt well directed and beautiful but hollow. None of my friends (who haven't read the books) had much to say about the story or the world. They liked how it looked, but it didn't leave much of an impact away from the production quality because they cut out so much of the depth that makes Dune what it is.

I understand that it's tough to get it all in, which is why I never expected them to, but I think they cut too much for me personally.",calls boring thinks nothing happens someone shares other posters view big part agree SO cut stuff like politics subterfuge film felt well directed beautiful hollow None friends havent read books much say story world liked looked didnt leave much impact away production quality cut so much depth makes Dune understand tough get never expected think cut too much personally,Positive

"Big fan of the books here, I agree with this sentiment entirely. What I liked was all those ""in only 5 mins they could have established..."" thoughts were things the movie didn't mention explicitly, but never overwrote. So often with book to screen they just change shit. A good example would be Dr Yueh. We dont delve into the Sukh school, imperial conditioning, etc. But notably we don't have a line of dialogue dismissing him as unreliable, or anything to contradict what the books held. You can watch the movie, then go read the book, and just get more information filled in, instead of seeing ""how it's different"".

I dunno if I'm expressing it right, but it just shows that everyone attached to the project understands the structure of the source material, whats important enough to keep, what just bloats and confuses first timers (eg a myriad of disposable characters we'll never see again at the dinner scene), and the otherwise inconsequential detsils capable of change so the story could molded to update and modernize it a bit (Kynes being a woman,a people of color actually existing, etc).

While I'd be one of the people in the demographic for a 5 hour movie, I think a TV series would have been excellent. I think the first two ""books"" of Dune could make for a wonderful season 1. Basically end around paul and the water of life. Season 2 picks up with the final third of Dune, before giving us messiah (which I think was good but not so able to stand-alone as it's own season). Season 2 ends with Paul into the desert. Season 3 Children, possibly split into 2 seasons. And I just really want God Emperor to be done. Talk about something ""I am totally down for, but can see why others might not be"" 😆 I can practically see the entertainment weekly article panning it as derivative of works that were written decades later, completely ignoring linear time.",Big fan books agree sentiment entirely liked only mins could established thoughts things movie didnt mention explicitly never overwrote So often book screen just change shit good example would Dr Yueh dont delve Sukh school imperial conditioning etc notably dont line dialogue dismissing unreliable anything contradict books held can watch movie go read book just get more information filled instead seeing different dunno Im expressing right just shows everyone attached project understands structure source material whats important enough keep just bloats confuses first timers eg myriad disposable characters well never see dinner scene otherwise inconsequential detsils capable change so story could molded update modernize bit Kynes womana people color actually existing etc Id one people demographic hour movie think TV series would excellent think first two books Dune could make wonderful season Basically end around paul water life Season picks final third Dune giving us messiah think good not so able standalone own season Season ends Paul desert Season Children possibly split seasons just really want God Emperor done Talk something totally can see others might not can practically see entertainment weekly article panning derivative works written decades later completely ignoring linear time,Positive

Dune makes very smart, economical changes that, in my opinion, really hold true to the intention of the book.

"Isn't weather just incredible?  I mean...what a difference that altitude alone can make in a local climate.

Here are some other temperature facts.

* The current record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe is 48C, which was registered in Athens, Greece, in 1977.
* Furnace Creek currently holds the record for hottest **air temperature** **ever recorded**. The desert valley reached highs of 56.7C in the summer of 1913.
* Lut desert, Iran has the hottest **ground temperatures** on the planet – satellite measurements (because the location is uninhabited) taken between 2003 and 2009 found a maximum temperature of a staggering 70.7C.  **Not 80C**.  Again... it is uninhabited, and the temperature is taken by satellite.  So you were about 10C off.
* The city of Quriyat recorded the highest ever minimum – ie night-time – temperature on 26 June 2018. The mercury didn’t get below 42.6C.
* ""The former capital of the Jafara district, 25 miles south of Tripoli, used to claim the title of hottest place on earth – in 1922 the temperature was recorded as a sweltering 58C. However, it was stripped of its title in 2012 when meteorologists declared this invalid due to a number of factors, including the fact that the person who recorded it was inexperienced. However, the town still regularly experiences temperatures of over 48C in midsummer.""
* Dallol, Ethiopia had an average daily maximum temperature of 41C recorded from 1960 to 1966, which makes it the place with the highest average temperature.
* 53.9C was recorded at Basra International Airport in Iraq on 22 July 2016.
* Turbat Pakistan, recorded the fourth highest ever temperature, 53.7C on 28 May 2017.
* Mitribah, Kuwait, hit 53.9C on 21 July 2016.
* The highest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa was 51.3C in Ouargla in the Algerian Sahara desert, on 5 July 2018.

The show showed a lot of Tony’s childhood. Also the cast is a mixed bag. Corey Stoll is a great actor, but I can’t really see him as Uncle Junior. Jon Bernthal (who’s playing Tony’s dad) and Vera Farmiga (Tony’s mom) are OK, but not great. Never heard of of Alessandro Nivola (Dickie Moltisanti, Christopher’s father) so I don’t know if he’s good or not and judging by the few bits I can pick up online he is the main actor. Finally we have Michael Gandolfini as Tony. There is no doubt it is touching that he is playing his father’s role, I just hope he is good (I have the same fears regarding Cooper Hoffman in PTA’s new film).

Finally there is the question of what the movie is about. I know it has something to do with the ‘67 riots, but I hear that Moltisanti is the main character and that Tony, being a teenager in it, might just be a supporting character. That might not interest a lot of people.

I find myself watching other services more than Netflix now. They have fantastic shows like Stranger Things, Ozar, The Witcher, Sabrina, etc. but several of those are about to end. Their older shows that helped popularize the service like House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, etc. are already finished. For every Marriage Story, Irishman, and Old Guard you get 15-20 Adam Sandler level movies. That's not worth $18 a month when HBO is sitting right there at $15 a month with all of HBO's greatest shows, classic movies, and the WB fare. Same goes for Disney+ at $7 currently. Sure they're limited to mostly back catalog right now and the price will go up, but with the MCU shows and animated fare coming it's well worth it.

I truly believe a movie like Everything Everywhere All At Once gets most recognition because Hollywood has shifted away from unique stand alone films which allows for this to be appreciated more than it should be. It’s an okay movie that drags on for a really really long and repetitive time.  There’s no reason it should be 2 hours and 20 min. It should be an at most 2 hour film. Cutting out 20 min isn’t changing any aspect of the film.,truly believe movie like Everything Everywhere gets most recognition Hollywood shifted away unique stand alone films allows appreciated more than should okay movie drags really really long repetitive time Theres no reason should hours min should most hour film Cutting min isnt changing aspect film,Positive

"Just to pile on another anecdote... I enjoyed Interstellar immensely, back in the day, and still now when I rewatch it every now and then. I think what I appreciate about it is...

1) the ""realistic sci-fi"" setting, where the (human) technology is clearly sci-fi, but not full of gimmicky space-age wonder — no computery blips and blops, transparent glass pane screens, pristine white walls, warp drives, holograms — that kind of stuff. It adds a certain type of believable grit to the setting.

2) It manages to strike a great balance on scale. The premise is big — they're essentially >!on a mission to prevent humanity from going extinct!<, but the narrative focusses very much on this particular set of people and their emotions. I've watched too many sci-fi films where the scale of the narrative largely overshadows any potential emotional impact.

3) the >!idea of catching up with your family after over 23 years passed in a few hours due to extreme time dilation!< is absolutely gut-wrenching.

4) perhaps almost most importantly, the soundtrack. It's so grandiose — the juxtaposition of the ""divine"" church organ blasting over scifi spaceship scenes is brilliant and in my opinion perfectly compliments the story and setting.",Just pile another anecdote enjoyed Interstellar immensely back day still now rewatch every now think appreciate realistic scifi setting human technology clearly scifi not full gimmicky spaceage wonder no computery blips blops transparent glass pane screens pristine white walls warp drives holograms kind stuff adds certain type believable grit setting manages strike great balance scale premise big theyre essentially mission prevent humanity going extinct narrative focusses very much particular set people emotions Ive watched too many scifi films scale narrative largely overshadows potential emotional impact idea catching family years passed few hours due extreme time dilation absolutely gutwrenching perhaps almost most importantly soundtrack so grandiose juxtaposition divine church organ blasting scifi spaceship scenes brilliant opinion perfectly compliments story setting,Positive

"Yi Yi being a lot lower here than on the industry professional poll isn't really surprising.

To compare it to another beloved East Asian classic that debuted at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, In The Mood for Love has a very similar placement here as it had on the industry poll, and on the industry poll Yi Yi wasn't far behind, but that's because people in the industry have seen both films.

Readers will have seen fewer films than the professionals on average, and it makes sense that a lot more people have seen the 90 minute yearning romance than the 180 minute movie whose plot is basically 'a large urban family in Taipei lives life'.

I love both films pretty equally, but Yi Yi is a harder sell, and with so many fewer people watching it, it's at a big disadvantage in a crowdsourced list. I'm glad it still made the top 100.

"For all those confused or who don't pay attention to movie news. There are six Dune books, Dune parts 1 and 2  cover the first book, Dune. The third film, whether they call it Dune Part 3 or whatever, covers the second book Dune Messiah, which is only 300+ compared to Dune's almost 900 pages. 

Although it's in the end of book 3  Herbert talks about how one of the main themes of Dune as a whole is an exploration of the Messiah myth. 

WHEN I WAS WRITING DUNE BY FRANK HERBERT . . . there was no room in my mind for concerns about the book’s success or failure. I was concerned only with the writing. Six years of research had preceded the day I sat down to put the story together, and the interweaving of the many plot layers I had planned required a degree of concentration I had never before experienced. **It was to be a story exploring the myth of the Messiah.** It was to produce another view of a human-occupied planet as an energy machine. It was to penetrate the interlocked workings of politics and economics. It was to be an examination of absolute prediction and its pitfalls. It was to have an awareness drug in it and tell what could happen through dependence on such a substance. Potable water was to be an analog for oil and for water itself, a substance whose supply diminishes each day.",confused dont pay attention movie news six Dune books Dune parts cover first book Dune third film whether call Dune Part whatever covers second book Dune Messiah only compared Dunes almost pages Although end book Herbert talks one main themes Dune whole exploration Messiah myth WRITING DUNE FRANK HERBERT no room mind concerns books success failure concerned only writing Six years research preceded day sat put story together interweaving many plot layers planned required degree concentration never experienced story exploring myth Messiah produce another view humanoccupied planet energy machine penetrate interlocked workings politics economics examination absolute prediction pitfalls awareness drug tell could happen dependence such substance Potable water analog oil water substance whose supply diminishes each day,Positive

Civil War was way too heavy for the character dramas and skipped the stuff most of us wanted to see - shrinking away from reality in the worst ways.

"Dear OP, first of all: WOW. 

I have a few questions. I find this post very intriguing... I am videogame buff and dabble in movies.

Question 1: How much do you pay to watch each film? i.e. Say you add all your monthy subs together and divide by 298, how much does viewing a single film on average cost?

Question 2: Do you have a professional setup to watch movies in 4k at home? i.e good tv/projector/speakers etc.?

Question 3: Do you work in the film/tv field? Feel free not no answer if you think this is too personal

Final question, question 4: Why do you like watching movies at the cinema rather than at home? I feel like you'd provide a really satifying answer here; on a side note, I was discussing this topic with friends not long ago and we came to the conclusion that going to the movies requires a long attention span and is a generational thing. Younger audiences hence prefer streaming services and watching movies from home.

Many thanks in advance for your time.

"I mean, I don't think Todd Phillips ever had the intention of adapting a comic. I think he had an idea and either  decided it was a vehicle better suited for the joker than the character he wrote, or he added the joker to get his idea made. I think he said all he had to say in the first one, and this is simply him admitting the first one isn't what the audience wanted it to be. 

He essentially, to me, is admitting Arthur is a character of his own creation. He's a fraudulent joker and only took that title because it was the path to success in order to get Phillips' vision made. 

So I think he wrote this as a cathartic way to not only flesh out his own feelings for ""selling out"" his character but also to make a movie he wants to make. Because there is some really, really good movie making here. It's gorgeous. It's competently directed. The performances are above average. But does it even come close to honoring the source material at all? 

Fuck no. 

The relations to the source material are as follows:

They acknowledge Gotham and Arkham.

He's called the Joker. 

A version of Harley Quinn exists

Harvey Dent exists

There might be other nods I missed, but that's all I saw related to Batman. 

So no, I don't think Todd Phillips ever considered making a comic book movie. The first one should have been called Arther Fleck or the laughter of Arther or something. The second one should not exist. 

TL/DR: This never was a comic book movie, and Todd Phillips wrote a meta sequel to kill off any idea that it ever was.",mean dont think Todd Phillips ever intention adapting comic think idea either decided vehicle better suited joker than character wrote added joker get idea made think said say first one simply admitting first one isnt audience wanted essentially admitting Arthur character own creation Hes fraudulent joker only took title path success order get Phillips vision made So think wrote cathartic way not only flesh own feelings selling character also make movie wants make some really really good movie making gorgeous competently directed performances average even come close honoring source material Fuck no relations source material follows acknowledge Gotham Arkham Hes called Joker version Harley Quinn exists Harvey Dent exists might other nods missed thats saw related Batman So no dont think Todd Phillips ever considered making comic book movie first one should called Arther Fleck laughter Arther something second one should not exist TLDR never comic book movie Todd Phillips wrote meta sequel kill idea ever,Positive

"Interesting bit of Oscar trivia that’s been overlooked: Fernanda Torres is part of the only mother/daughter combo ever to be both nominated for Best Actress — her mom, Fernanda Montenegra, was nominated in 1999 for Central Station (and appeared in I’m Still Here as the main character in later life). Not even Ingrid and Isabella can make that claim. 

Mother and daughter were also both in the movie Four Days in September, a brilliant psychological thriller from 1997, the true story of the kidnapping of the U.S. Ambassador to Brazil with Alan Arkin as the ambassador. It lost to Life is Beautiful as best foreign film, but well worth a watch if you a find it. The movie kind of asks, how would any of us do with a gun to our head and a hooded terrorist demanding the names of the CIA officers in the embassy. Torres plays one of the kidnappers, betrayed by her own naïveté about the true nature of violence and revolution.",Interesting bit Oscar trivia thats overlooked Fernanda Torres part only motherdaughter combo ever nominated Best Actress mom Fernanda Montenegra nominated Central Station appeared Im Still main character later life Not even Ingrid Isabella can make claim Mother daughter also movie Four Days September brilliant psychological thriller true story kidnapping US Ambassador Brazil Alan Arkin ambassador lost Life Beautiful best foreign film well worth watch find movie kind asks would us gun head hooded terrorist demanding names CIA officers embassy Torres plays one kidnappers betrayed own navet true nature violence revolution,Positive

The musicianship is extraordinary, and this is not your normal orchestral score.”   
  
It fits very well with the books, as most of the pre-chapter quotes of the first novel are from the various writings of Princess Irulan, and Lady Jessica, Reverend Mother Mohiam and the Bene Gesserit in general are so central in driving, conserving and communicating the story.",One part really like article OP linked apart apparently inventing new instruments Indeed Zimmer took approach since Dune different civilization would invent instruments accompany concept One thing two felt would hold true civilization though power human voice Denis agreed female characters film drive story explained composer So score based mainly female voices developed own language musicianship extraordinary not normal orchestral score fits very well books most prechapter quotes first novel various writings Princess Irulan Lady Jessica Reverend Mother Mohiam Bene Gesserit general so central driving conserving communicating story,Positive

"**Spoilers from the book ahead**

He's not very active, but he is set up pretty early as Paul's.. mirror? Rival? Alternate?

He sits around as the Baron speaks, but we're made clear that he is to follow in line. He's not just being lectured to, he's being *groomed*, in a way that mirrors Paul's own grooming, but with Harkonnen underhandness in contrast to Atreides dignity.

We're also informed of the plan to have him come to Arrakis as it's saviour following the removal of Piter/Rabban. We are made aware how important he is, and how key a piece he is in the plans the Baron is laying out.

Additionally, we're told that he is the other half of the key that the Bene Gesserit were planning to use to seal the breach between the two families, to whom the Atreides daughter would've been wed had Jessica not disobeyed her instructions.

Building on this, we can start to make inferences (I can't remember if it's outright stated) about Harkonnen aspirations through Feyd as a result of Paul's own declaration of his intent to seek the throne through Irulan.

All in all, this amounts to a fair amount of intwinement into the story for his character. His critical importance in the second half of the book is laid upon the foundation that is laid, albeit briefly, in the first half. In a complex story with lots of moving parts, that character introduction and development is ~~vital~~ *very useful* in order to set any kind of meaningful stage later on.

I agree that it makes no sense to fuse his character with Rabban. But I think his omission from the first half, while understandable in the context of attempting to adapt the book into an accessible film, is indicative of just how much meat has been cut. As a result the story told is, if not outright lacking (which I would claim), at the very least substantially different to the one in the book.",Spoilers book ahead Hes not very active set pretty early Pauls mirror Rival Alternate sits around Baron speaks made clear follow line Hes not just lectured hes groomed way mirrors Pauls own grooming Harkonnen underhandness contrast Atreides dignity also informed plan come Arrakis saviour following removal PiterRabban made aware important key piece plans Baron laying Additionally told other half key Bene Gesserit planning use seal breach two families Atreides daughter wouldve wed Jessica not disobeyed instructions Building can start make inferences cant remember outright stated Harkonnen aspirations Feyd result Pauls own declaration intent seek throne Irulan amounts fair amount intwinement story character critical importance second half book laid upon foundation laid albeit briefly first half complex story lots moving parts character introduction development vital very useful order set kind meaningful stage later agree makes no sense fuse character Rabban think omission first half understandable context attempting adapt book accessible film indicative just much meat cut result story told not outright lacking would claim very least substantially different one book,Positive

I'm not talking about critical reception.  It's had good legs in most countries and consistently done well on premium formats (e.g. IMAX) and an A- Cinemascore despite extremely misleading advertising.  This is generally a good sign for a sequel.

"Absolute 10/10 movie in my option. 

Major props to the director and creators it captured the magic of musicals so well. I know they put a ton of work into set building and reducing the amount of CGI that we’re overloaded with these days especially for fantasy movies - it really paid off. It’s hard to put into words but a lot of other issues I have with modern movies aren’t present here - it’s not shallow, lazy or generic, it feels special and almost timeless in a way.

Cynthia was unbelievable not just her voice but her acting, she must be an absolute certainty for an Oscar and it would be fully deserved. Whatever drama there is on social media or claims of being ‘toxic’ won’t overshadow a truly perfect performance. I would challenge anyone to watch this movie and deny she absolutely knocks every scene out of the park.

Ariana was better than I expected especially in the second half of the movie. She really did shine in a number of scenes but I’m not 100% sold on her casting still. 

That being said their chemistry was fantastic and their dance at the party was beautifully done. 

For anyone worried about the running time they managed this perfectly with the action in later half, it didn’t feel like almost 3 hours for me. I was smiling through 90% because it was such a joy to watch and such a relief that they did it justice and honored the musical. Fans will love it, if you’re not a fan of the musical maybe it’s not for you but you still wouldn’t be able to deny they’ve done an amazing job (for part 1 anyways).",Absolute movie option Major props director creators captured magic musicals so well know put ton work set building reducing amount CGI overloaded days especially fantasy movies really paid hard put words lot other issues modern movies arent present not shallow lazy generic feels special almost timeless way Cynthia unbelievable not just voice acting must absolute certainty Oscar would fully deserved Whatever drama social media claims toxic wont overshadow truly perfect performance would challenge anyone watch movie deny absolutely knocks every scene park Ariana better than expected especially second half movie really shine number scenes Im not sold casting still said chemistry fantastic dance party beautifully done anyone worried running time managed perfectly action later half didnt feel like almost hours smiling such joy watch such relief justice honored musical Fans will love youre not fan musical maybe not still wouldnt able deny theyve done amazing job part anyways,Positive

Absolute standout scene was “Popular” and Ariana’s comedic acting made it. Set and costume there also excellent.

My criticisms:
- Glinda’s singing early on, ie. the intro, is unintelligible. Maybe mixing issue. Couldn’t understand the townspeople chorus either.
- Michelle Yeoh is an it girl right now but while she did well for a non-singer, she was a non-singer.

"Here is my review that I posted on the Broadway sub
—


Just got home from the advanced screening. 

Context: saw it in NYC with Idina, caught two tours through San Francisco, read the book looong before the musical was conceived. 

Overall:
10/10

The good:

* It was a candy buffet for the eyes- just beautiful. The costumes, sets, choreography.  

* The added length gave more time to deepen the bonds of their friendship and better illustrate the cruelty towards animals, adding so much emotional depth.  

* lots of little Easter eggs and homage to both the original movie and to the stage production 

* the original orchestration was preserved and elevated, rather than trying to make it something “new”. And it was gorgeous 

* was prepared to be utterly off put by Ariana - but consider me converted. She pulled it off well without coming across as a mimicry of Kristen. Yes, definitely pulled in pieces of it, but she also made it her own. However, it took me a bit to let go of the comparisons.  
 
* Cynthia was breathtaking. Given her drama queen antics of late, I was afraid it would ruin her role for me.  But all of that is forgotten breath quickly - even her speaking voice is charismatic 

* Jonathan Bailey did a great job.  I was afraid he was too old or wouldn’t be able to sing. He brought the ultimate swank and playboy energy.  

* so much comedy! 

* cameos! I won’t ruin them, I only knew of one. The theater ERUPTED at one point. (Yes, I was with my people) 

* songs where the delivery was different were still done tastefully and beautiful. I was afraid we would get some Mariah Carey trilling up and down the octaves. 

The not so good

* I don’t have much to say - there was no point where I felt thrust back into reality because something felt forced or missed 

* Michelle Yeoh really didn’t bring much, I think it could have been someone else. 

* yes, Jeff Goldblum is really not a singer. 

* you don’t get the same vocal power that we get to experience in live theater. As much as Defying Gravity was amazing - I wasn’t covered in goosebumps like I am when hearing it live and belted. Is that sound editing? Mixing? Dunno.

"The trailers haven’t totally sold me, but it’s a very talented cast, and at least IMO, Jon Chu has a strong record with his last two outings being Crazy Rich Asians and In the Heights, both of which I was a big fan of, and the latter being a stage-to-screen adaptation of a musical. 

From the people that I follow that have seen it, I’ve read good things with the major negative being the washed out color grading that seemingly everyone and their mother has pointed out. A shame for the set designers, because the behind the scenes photos of the sets they built for this movie **are fucking astonishing** with how great they look, and to see them being desaturated is a real shame. 

With such positive buzz coming out of these reviews though, I’m looking forward to it a bit more.s",trailers havent totally sold very talented cast least IMO Jon Chu strong record last two outings Crazy Rich Asians Heights big fan latter stagetoscreen adaptation musical people follow seen Ive read good things major negative washed color grading seemingly everyone mother pointed shame set designers behind scenes photos sets built movie fucking astonishing great look see desaturated real shame such positive buzz coming reviews though Im looking forward bit mores,Positive

"Am I the only one who was unimpressed? There were a few very poignant, moving scenes for me… but the tone was childish and there was no subtlety whatsoever 

In the broadway recording you rly do believe Galinda possesses the duality of being both imaged obsessed and capable of a meaningful relationship w elphaba… 
Ariana’s Glinda felt hamfisted, gimmicky, and flimsy - how many times can the Elle woods hair swish be funny, really? The whooshing sound effects that accompanied every one of her movements was like the equivalent of jingling keys for a baby for Christ’s sake, really, i draw the line at being treated as a toddler in any setting

In that same vein, they didn’t allow a single moment of ambiguity or subtlety to pass/ I felt like I was being spoon-fed the intended emotional point of each exchange by characters summing it up vocally AND by the over-involved score hammering it home  
That’s just bad story telling. If there’s no room for nuance or interpretation, what’s left for the audience to do than to turn off their brains and clap and bark along like trained seals .. for THREE hours? I want my autonomy back 

Also - the music kept competing w the actual vocals of the songs, like… I can’t be the only one who felt that way, that’s a bad job if the voices are being drowned out by the instrumentals. It felt like they were rolling out the carpet for the legacy of the musical numbers themselves without hOldINg SpACe for the vocals themselves or to let the numbers feel at all authentic to their scenes 

I was reeled back in at fieryo’s number, I teared up at the dance scene and the defying gravity sequence was chilling - I appreciated the chase scene right before then, rly drove some sense of terror home and I appreciated how real Glinda’s helplessness and the precariousness of their situation felt there 
Choreography was entertaining 
Overall too hamfisted

"I think the problem is the subplot wasn’t fleshed out much. Why do they hate the animals? Because they’re  different that’s literally it. In real life oppressed demographics get hated because of specific, misguided reasons engineered by the elite, not literally only “because they’re different.” Feels very shallow and we get beat over the head with the “hated because they’re different” message the entire movie; i feel like they could’ve come up with a more realistic angle but I guess this is basically a kids movie so my expectations are probably too high

There are also no animal characters that we get a chance to know and get attached to except for 10 minutes of the goat professor, who spends the whole screen time giving us exposition about the animal hatred premise, so we really don’t know anything about him. We don’t see how animals used to be an integrated part of Oz society so seeing their absence from it doesn’t exactly hit us hard. 

Also, the whole animal conflict doesn’t even exist in the story except for scenes to drive elphaba’s character  forward. Not a single other character references it on their own. It doesn’t really shape the universe we are watching in any meaningful way. And again we don’t have enough talking animal characters to empathize with. Elphaba is literally the only person who ever brings it up; It’s obviously just used as a tool to show us that the wicked witch is actually a saint who cares about justice

"Slight spoilers ahead

I watched the movie the other night. If part 1 was epic, this movie is beyond words. Totally worth the wait, I was the one in the theaters for part 1 actively mad at the filmmakers for ending it where it did.

One small thing I wanted to bring up. I thought it was weird at first how Jessica's pregnancy was handled, and it felt disturbing at first. I was confused why it was done that way, and from what I understand, is majorly different from the books (haven't read them quite yet).

Then I realized just recently, it was the only way the film could portray the passage of time without spoon-feeding it. The first part of the movie conceivably happened in only a couple days, a week at the most. However, all of the moving parts of the plot in the second part needed actual time to pass in universe in order to get the conclusion it needed. 

To avoid having subtitled cards reading ""X months later"" the film cleverly reestablishes Jessica's pregnancy to the audience, and then shows the fetus at various stages of development or Jessica's baby bump showing in various scenes. This shows the viewers a rough timeline and of how much time is passing between scenes without making us consciously aware that so much time is passing. 

It's just such a smart and cool way to establish a plotline's timetable. I wasn't even aware of the pregnancy being also used as a narrative device until way after I left the theater.",Slight spoilers ahead watched movie other night part epic movie beyond words Totally worth wait one theaters part actively mad filmmakers ending One small thing wanted bring thought weird first Jessicas pregnancy handled felt disturbing first confused done way understand majorly different books havent read quite yet realized just recently only way film could portray passage time without spoonfeeding first part movie conceivably happened only couple days week most However moving parts plot second part needed actual time pass universe order get conclusion needed avoid subtitled cards reading X months later film cleverly reestablishes Jessicas pregnancy audience shows fetus various stages development Jessicas baby bump showing various scenes shows viewers rough timeline much time passing scenes without making us consciously aware so much time passing just such smart cool way establish plotlines timetable wasnt even aware pregnancy also used narrative device way left theater,Positive

"I may be in a minority, but I didn’t like it much. The directing was awe-inspiring, the acting generally as good as it could be, but Part 2 is just hampered by the story itself, and too much ‘stuff’. 

The first film was fabulous, probably because for the most part it was tight and taut and told predominantly the story of the betrayal of a great house. Characters were given space to breathe, time felt like it passed, there was genuine space for emotion…

Part 2 is just too overstuffed, too frenetic. It has that sense that characters are simply saying words to propel the plot. The emotional payoffs just aren’t there, and even the big arc - Paul’s acceptance of his role and transformation into a monster - doesn’t really land. This happens. Then that. Then a new character. Then someone dies. Then a big finale and the credits roll and it’s just… empty. 

Anyway, that’s my spoiler-free opinion. Interested to see if any others agree with me, because my sense leaving that IMAX was that others in the audience also felt underwhelmed.",may minority didnt like much directing aweinspiring acting generally good could Part just hampered story too much stuff first film fabulous probably most part tight taut told predominantly story betrayal great house Characters given space breathe time felt like passed genuine space emotion Part just too overstuffed too frenetic sense characters simply saying words propel plot emotional payoffs just arent even big arc Pauls acceptance role transformation monster doesnt really land happens new character someone dies big finale credits roll just empty Anyway thats spoilerfree opinion Interested see others agree sense leaving IMAX others audience also felt underwhelmed,Positive

More interestingly - I think the point is that we envision an Emperor figure as some god figure. Someone above reproach, imposing, etc. but, in reality, that is rarely the case. Monarchs and Dictators throughout history have often been odd. Weird looks, voices. Often the result of inbreeding.

Baron Harkonnen is an extension of this same theme.

I think that’s entirely the point. The “Emperor” is just a title - his power is tenuous and not rooted in anything that makes him inherently better than anyone else.

Edit: at the risk of getting political. Think about Putin, Xi and Trump. All of these guys are weird looking and have plenty of odd behaviors. Listening to them speak, you basically go, “Who the fuck appointed this guy?”

"I mean that “rushy” feeling is very much in the books as well. Herbert didn’t really write action well and a lot of OG Dune is people preaching about how dangerous and lethal the Fremen are without really giving the reader many opportunities to understand the tactical advantage they have over offworlders except that they’re hard-boiled and well-trained. The result is that this Harkonnen/Fremen war feels very sterile and non-threatening until it very suddenly becomes the center of the story. Hell, even the final battle of the film is entirely glossed over in the book and covered with a paragraph long summary of what happened just so Paul can conveniently end up in the same room as all of his enemies… it’s a little jarring in the books because it feels like the author couldn’t really be bothered to write the middle part of that story or justify the conflict in an thematically interesting way.

Above all DV an amazing job of just that, you totally understand how the Fremen could simultaneously be incredibly feared yet continuously underestimated which helps make to make the really sudden escalation of conflict feel a little more earned. I think that was the correct element to flesh out for this portion of the story too, as I think the first part tried (and did a decent job) of capturing the political element of Dune, hopefully the third movie will focus cinematically on the spirituality of the series, which seems like a natural evolution given that it should cover the holy war that Paul is foreseeing.",mean rushy feeling very much books well Herbert didnt really write action well lot OG Dune people preaching dangerous lethal Fremen without really giving reader many opportunities understand tactical advantage offworlders except theyre hardboiled welltrained result HarkonnenFremen war feels very sterile nonthreatening very suddenly becomes center story Hell even final battle film entirely glossed book covered paragraph long summary happened just so Paul can conveniently end same room enemies little jarring books feels like author couldnt really bothered write middle part story justify conflict thematically interesting way DV amazing job just totally understand Fremen could simultaneously incredibly feared yet continuously underestimated helps make make really sudden escalation conflict feel little more earned think correct element flesh portion story too think first part tried decent job capturing political element Dune hopefully third movie will focus cinematically spirituality series seems like natural evolution given should cover holy war Paul foreseeing,Positive

"Sure,  spoilers ahead:

>!In the books, Jamis' death is treated as a moment for Paul to learn the price of taking a life, where Jessica berates him for killing someone to stop him from getting too used to being overly worshiped by the Fremen. They cut it out of the end of Part 1, I was expecting for it to maybe be moved to Jamis' funeral at the beginning of Part 2, but it wasn't. The film storyline about Jamis being Paul's ""spirit guide"", while it can make conceivable sense, never shows up in the book. So, Jamis' function in the narrative is totally changed. Since I mentioned Jessica, her actions in the books are also less outwardly sinister. There are parts where she becomes scared of Paul becoming the Kwisatz Haderach in the book but in the film she just kind of pushes him without any sort of concern for what she's turning him into.!<

>!Regarding the crying, Jessica cries when she sees the water basin at Sietch Tabr, and Stilgar stops her while saying something along the lines of ""water is precious, we don't cry for the dead"". In the book, Paul cries after he kills Jamis because he recognizes that it was a totally unnecessary death, and this becomes significant for the Fremen because giving water for the dead is seen more as a profound sign of respect for the dead. The cultural element is given almost a total 180 in the movie.!<

"This is some crazy shit OP, well done! 😅

Just a few random thoughts, but I also love that shot in Far and Away with the fence behind him, he looks like he’s flying.

While brief, the dream sequence in Born on the Fourth of July where he gets up and starts running out of the hospital is such a sad and powerful callback to what Kovic was before the war.

The exploding fish tank is still probably the most iconic moment in all of Mission: Impossible to me, but the fact that Cruise looks scared for his life because he kinda sorta was (see: your [Graham Norton Show](https://youtu.be/rfDXRsDpQcE) reference) makes it even better.

What’s super impressive about all the running Cruise does in these movies is the realization he has to do it over so many takes? The running scenes in The Firm, Fallout, and Dead Reckoning are all long enough in the final cut as it is, lol.

[ESPN’s article](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/33966556/tom-cruise-running-top-gun-maverick) is a great read and also points out how his characters are usually not wearing clothes or shoes that are ideal for running, either.

"Idk have to say good try?


With the way dragons and dinosaurs can be developed in movies today it is fairly disappointing to see so little of the sandworms and so few moments from the books where the worms were a vital factor in the main story.


So many people are confused in the comments about the sandworms stuff like ""how do they get off the worms though?"" and ""how come they go from being so scary to becoming taxis?"" when the first two books easily walk the reader through all sorts of cute factoids about wormies and if that's what you're into- sandwormies- then hey you're going to love Frank Herbert and his sons continued work on Sandworms of Dune.


Just saying, it seems like whoever decided to get less shots of sandworms and less shots of the sietches and futuristic cities of Arrakis lol, Dune wasn't even a two part book but they needlessly stretched out one book like there's a Hunger Games level of young fans excited to go see each half in theaters year after year or something lol. Such a weird way to shed light on an important issue regarding Hollywood and Asia taking books written pretty gosh darn well and attempting to turn it all into a quick hype hi fi money grab by throwing terrible ungifted actors and cheap special effects followed up by Michael Bay explosions.


I watched the first movie after watching Sci Fi Channels mini series and after watching every Cut of the original 1980's attempt at Dune before Frank Herbert died, I've read all of Frank Herberts Dune specific books and a few of his other books too just to feel around and see if there's anything else similar to JRR Tolkien ya know, some random short stories or weird characters that they can't seem to make room for in the main money maker they're known for lol.


Comparing Rings of Power to the Lord of the Rings movies for example, you're asking for all kinds of trouble from the different audiences and fans who have come together to try and enjoy Tolkiens work a while longer, this is a similar experience I am finding with Frank Herberts work.


He's got a solid storyline and it could be adapted to become a high budgeted series that could have walked us from young Leto I to Paul son and Leto II becoming the main characters, to all weird creepy humanoid characters and genetic cloning and Other Memory, but it's so odd that there's only the same old ""origin story"" type shenanigans similar to Spiderman where we are constantly getting new Spidermen who are all just starting out and not just randomly getting a major motion picture where Spidey is doing his Thang like it ain't no thang and he's teaming up with everyone from Fantastic Four to X Men for a scene or two for example and fighting big baddies like ... IDK it's not up to me lol.


Just saying we all already know who Peter fricking Parker is by now Who Is This For?? 


Frank Herbert is a well known writer for his obvious by now contributions to Science Fiction in general across the board he's inspired people like Stephen King and George Lucas and the people who brought us all kinds of creepy crawly movies and epic sci fi adventures. He isn't exactly an easy read though. But it doesn't mean you don't give it a shot lol.


I read Lord of The Rings then watched the movies as a kid because I didn't want to see the movies first, it makes the original authors ideas and their original version stand out in my mind so when I watch someone else's corporate sponsored and ""Buy This Today with Next day Air Delivery"" option on my screen I have doubts the director and script writers and whoever else over in magic movie land actually tried at all to stick to the original authors reasoning behind their work. A lot of deeper messages hidden stuff can be completely overlooked and cut out and even reverso betrayed when rights are purchased and authors are dead and gone but their fans are here supplying support and demand for more More! It can be confusing I'm sure for anyone to see the situation and opportunities to make profits from naive fanbase coming back year after year hoping for an official release that is worthy of the original creators namesake and not another washed down propaganda machine used to convince us to purchase and buy either into a new product or old idea or aid during wartime or whatever instead of not confuse us and allow us the opportunity to enjoy a good story being turned into film.


Dune 1 and 2 did not meet qualifications but they did meet expectations. They were exactly as I figured they'd be, didn't see the second but doubt there will be anything surprising beyond cheap effects and a sudden need to purchase LVMH cologne due to the whole movie looking like at any moment they were going to turn to the camera and say ""I'm a wolf.""


Just weird to not include some more of the books details, extra characters and factoids about the Bene Gesserit and Other Memory being mentioned already and so on, idk seems like if they're going to make a 2 part movie of one book it sure seems like there was enough left out to make more room for weird silent close ups of Timothy Chalamet looking like a lost angry teenager in a mall parking lot. 


What is I guess most disheartening about seeing Dune get turned into another money pit for Hollywood producers is that if they just read the books themselves, not just Dune 1 and Dune 2 in the series lol, but like read the books instead of masturbating to video call girls for a change they could have learned about the little details that connect an entire franchise together and keeps bringing fans back whenever a new random prequel and or pre prequel or a side story in between the main story lol is released. 


There are some good ideas in the first 3 books sure, but it doesn't really get good until God Emperor dies and that's when you finally understand Frank Herberts ideas from Dune 1 lol. The dude is a genius in his own right and the way he put together so many moving mechanisms that interacted with different books and practically forces you to keep reading, a rare author to find so it's super important that when a movie deal pops up the writers and directors and people directly involved in all the important decisions that end up on screen it would be good that they also read Frank Herberts books all the way through Chapterhouse.

During the filming of Jaws, a real great white attacked the cage and Spielberg gleefully included it in the film, revising the script to fit it.  He was quite happy to show as much real shark as he could.

Same thing for the Alien movie.  In the scenes where we get a good look at the Alien, it's kinda goofy looking.

Contrast this to Predator.  The alien costume looked fantastic, so the filmmakers gave it a lot of screentime.

These films had top-of-the-line effects.  There could have been plenty of awesome sandworm scenes.

"Read the books. Read Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and read God Emperor and Heretics and Chapterhouse. You get to learn alllll about the wormies in Frank Herberts work and not whatever these movies are selling you- the LVMH Louis Votton version of his work lol. 


Gotta read at least up till you get to Heretics, God Emperor is the end of Pauls sons story finally but it's not really an ending and more like a thoroughly written explanation of how knowing history can make time seem blurred and allow some things to become nearly immortal and others permanently alter the fabric of our existence.


Frank Herbert had a way of offering us all an examination of the entire world, our customs and languages and differences and similarities and histories and technically Frank Herbert was a Master Historian professionally, not just a writer so the way he organizes his ideas and views so that it might actually take reading multiple books to truly grasp what he was laying down book one.


But everyone who wants to spin his work into quick profits (similar to Jeff Longs book The Descent its rights were purchased and they turned it into a cheap horror movie when there was real seriousness and historical anecdotes and bizarrely realistically terrifyingly relatable ideas in Jeffs Long book that you end up with another slasher film lol instead of, like, Journey to The Center of The Earth meets Predator, if they had made the movie closer to the book by even a margin it would've been amazing).


I lost my rant for a sec- you gotta read Frank and then rewatch these billionaire sponsored versions after and ask for yourself if it lives up to Frank Herberts vision or if there's some twists in there that weren't necessary, if they cut out more dialogue because certain actors can't act, and if the whole movie(s) don't feel more like a men's cologne commercial or another edition of Chronicles of Riddick and less Frank Herberts original iconic work.

"Unfortunately I don't think the complex multipolar politics of the books can be explained in a fulsome way in a film. They were lighter on exposition than I would have liked, especially on the key point of who Paul is levering with his threat about destroying the spice - it's not the Emperor, it's not the Landsraat; it's the Spacing Guild whose very existence he's threatening and it's the Guild who has the power to surrender or fight, everyone else is just a spectator - but I don't know that they could ever do the complexity of the worldbuilding justice in a film. The choice sort of has to be made one way or another - you can't half explain the Guild or its relationship to the Imperium, or the Emperor's relationship with the Landsraat; you either do it fully or you just do the vaguest contours necessary for the rest of the story.

The lightness of the exposition also allowed the writers to alter the story somewhat to be more about Fremen self-determination, with Indigenous liberation/anti-colonialist overtones that are a much better fit with contemporary audiences. The original books really are very much a white savior kind of story. The whole concept of Paul - heir to an interplanetary fief that is amongst the proudest and most prominent in a Galaxy-spanning Imperium - being so deeply concerned with the importance of Indigenous self-determination frankly never made a lot of sense. This kid has been raised since birth to play power games with entire star systems, entirely aside from his Bene Gesserit training. Removing some of that context allowed the writers to shape the character in a way that's more sympathetic to the audience. Things like Paul's reluctance to take on leadership - in the books that's entirely related to his foreseeing the billions that will die as a result. That characterization is almost entirely changed in the movie to focus on Fremen self-determination. I think it plays well in the end, but it's not the same story in many respects.",Unfortunately dont think complex multipolar politics books can explained fulsome way film lighter exposition than would liked especially key point Paul levering threat destroying spice not Emperor not Landsraat Spacing Guild whose very existence hes threatening Guild power surrender fight everyone else just spectator dont know could ever complexity worldbuilding justice film choice sort made one way another cant half explain Guild relationship Imperium Emperors relationship Landsraat either fully just vaguest contours necessary rest story lightness exposition also allowed writers alter story somewhat more Fremen selfdetermination Indigenous liberationanticolonialist overtones much better fit contemporary audiences original books really very much white savior kind story whole concept Paul heir interplanetary fief amongst proudest most prominent Galaxyspanning Imperium so deeply concerned importance Indigenous selfdetermination frankly never made lot sense kid raised since birth play power games entire star systems entirely aside Bene Gesserit training Removing some context allowed writers shape character way thats more sympathetic audience Things like Pauls reluctance take leadership books thats entirely related foreseeing billions will die result characterization almost entirely changed movie focus Fremen selfdetermination think plays well end not same story many respects,Positive

"Come and See (1985). It was a recommendation that came up in WW2 circles as a not-terrible look into what Nazi occupation looked like in Belarus. I watched it a year ago for the first time.


I was warned, as I will warn you now, of two distinct things.


First, it’s a Soviet film that’s trying to be ahead of its time in 1985. There are long stretches of a young fella hitting himself with a wet tree branch. There’s close-ups of people’s faces talking real slow and weird for long periods of time. It’s a friggin weird film quite often. You might want to look up which parts to skip (because they are pointless, imo).


Second, when the depraved acts of inhumanity start to occur, they are traumatizing. Not always well acted by everyone, but the central characters do a good enough job, even when the makeup and stuff looks fake. This movie is horrifying when the bad shit starts. I lost quite a bit of sleep. I yelled “No! Don’t go with them!” At the tv. I stood up like I could chase the characters and plead with them.


Ebert said it might be the greatest anti-war film ever made and I can see why. But, war is traumatizing and this film shows it in a traumatic way.


Everyone should watch it, but nobody should watch it. The whole thing is on YouTube.",Come See recommendation came WW circles notterrible look Nazi occupation looked like Belarus watched year ago first time warned will warn now two distinct things First Soviet film thats trying ahead time long stretches young fella hitting wet tree branch Theres closeups peoples faces talking real slow weird long periods time friggin weird film quite often might want look parts skip pointless imo Second depraved acts inhumanity start occur traumatizing Not always well acted everyone central characters good enough job even makeup stuff looks fake movie horrifying bad shit starts lost quite bit sleep yelled No Dont go tv stood like could chase characters plead Ebert said might greatest antiwar film ever made can see war traumatizing film shows traumatic way Everyone should watch nobody should watch whole thing YouTube,Negative

"1917 is weirdly enough \*the movie\* that really nailed down the futility of war to me.

If you take a step back and look at it, what did the main protagonist actually achieve? Not some epic battle or victory. All he basically did was go down the road and deliver a message, that may or may not have even ultimately mattered (""That's it for now and then next week command will send a different message."") And yet these incredibly young men have had their lives irrevocably changed forever. Throwing their lives away, for \*basically nothing.\* War is not epic or badass. It's truly a tragedy, and it makes you really hate the warmongering top brass who are so far removed from the ground floor of combat.

Absolutely beautiful, and the most effective ""anti-war"" movie I've ever seen.

EDIT: I also wanted to point out how effective the ""one-take"" gimmick is towards this sentiment as well. I know there are some gaps in the movie where the protagonist is passed out, but ignoring that, we the audience basically go through the same passage of time as the protagonist. Just 3 hours and your entire life is changed, just like that \*snap fingers\*",weirdly enough movie really nailed futility war take step back look main protagonist actually achieve Not some epic battle victory basically go road deliver message may may not even ultimately mattered Thats now next week command will send different message yet incredibly young men lives irrevocably changed forever Throwing lives away basically nothing War not epic badass truly tragedy makes really hate warmongering top brass so far removed ground floor combat Absolutely beautiful most effective antiwar movie Ive ever seen EDIT also wanted point effective onetake gimmick towards sentiment well know some gaps movie protagonist passed ignoring audience basically go same passage time protagonist Just hours entire life changed just like snap fingers,Positive

Far too many people don't know what character development is, too. Rogue One for example has far more character development than the average Star Wars movie; nearly every character goes through a dramatic change.

Jin Erso wants nothing to do with the rebellion at the start of the movie, and by the end she's willing to die for it. 

Cassian is a ruthless cold blooded killer who will do anything to achieve his goals, including killing innocent people; by the end of the film he's at peace and dies in his friend's arms.

"Ahh this is fantastic! Congratulations, that’s a stellar review. I love the way you described how Jeff captured the look and feel of the period. You gave a glimpse into the content very well & I really appreciate that you talked about the original reference material! Haha you tied it together so nicely and reminded me of that AMAZING Easy Rider moment 😂

I totally agree with your opinion that this was a career high performance from Hardy. The closest I think I’ve seen him get to this kind of character was his role in Lawless- it’s very impressive how much he’s matured as an actor since then!

And thank you so much for giving Jodie the time you did. Her character is absolutely the backbone of the story & although I’ll admit I haven’t seen more than one trailer for the film, all the posters and imagery I’ve seen has never included her. I completely understand that the aesthetic appeal of this film is huge & it makes sense to market that up front (the men on bikes, leather jackets, wide open spaces). 

I was lucky enough to get to be at an early screening in December that Nichols did a Q&A at and I will say it made me really happy how much emphasis he put on Comers importance to the project. 
One of my favorite anecdotes he told was about the first scene Hardy & Comer filmed together: 
-apparently they hadn’t spoken prior to the scene and after Jeff got the scene wrapped he said Tom walked up to him and basically said “What the fuck just happened- I did awful, I don’t have that kind of talent” and Jeff said “That’s why I hired her!” 🥰",Ahh fantastic Congratulations thats stellar review love way described Jeff captured look feel period gave glimpse content very well really appreciate talked original reference material Haha tied together so nicely reminded AMAZING Easy Rider moment totally agree opinion career high performance Hardy closest think Ive seen get kind character role Lawless very impressive much hes matured actor since thank so much giving Jodie time character absolutely backbone story although Ill admit havent seen more than one trailer film posters imagery Ive seen never included completely understand aesthetic appeal film huge makes sense market front men bikes leather jackets wide open spaces lucky enough get early screening December Nichols QA will say made really happy much emphasis put Comers importance project One favorite anecdotes told first scene Hardy Comer filmed together apparently hadnt spoken prior scene Jeff got scene wrapped said Tom walked basically said fuck just happened awful dont kind talent Jeff said Thats hired,Positive

"So, Dune has cleared $220M at the box office so far.  Will that be enough?  What would be the minimum amount needed to break even and how much would be required to justify making the 2nd movie?

Will they say, *""A subscriber's first viewing of the movie counts as $2 earned?""* - that is to say, *""We'll count $2 of a viewer's $15 or $7.5 / month subscription fee as being attributed the offering of the movie""* or what?
Or did the HBO accounting unit pay the Dune production a royalty, say $200M, to show the film?

I've seen it 2 and a half times now (twice while fully alert and once where my wife was watching and I fell asleep on and off, hence the half) via my $7.50/month HBO Max subscription, and I haven't paid one direct penny to actually see it yet.

"Dune was a movie not made for China. There's an issue with movies made with the Chinese market in mind where key plot points are explicitly explained by characters word-by-word (Transformers Age of Extinction, Pacific Rim,  Fast series).

"I think when taking HBO Max into account, around a $300-$350 million box office total would be a modest success.  To be frank, the relatively low domestic take of $40 million really isn't that great, especially when you consider the high production budget and that studios see the highest return on domestic ticket sales.  For comparison, consider that *Halloween Kills* opened at $50 million domestically, at 1/8th of the production budget of *Dune*.

In other words, this isn't quite the resounding success that some are making it out to be.  I think that the domestic drop off next week will give a much better indicator of how the movie will fare in the long run.  If it drops off as badly as *Blade Runner 2049* did, then *Dune: Part 2* could potentially be dead in the water.",think taking HBO Max account around million box office total would modest success frank relatively low domestic take million really isnt great especially consider high production budget studios see highest return domestic ticket sales comparison consider Halloween Kills opened million domestically th production budget Dune other words isnt quite resounding success some making think domestic drop next week will give much better indicator movie will fare long run drops badly Blade Runner Dune Part could potentially dead water,Positive

I think with how much SW has drawn from Dune and has gone in weirder places for the last 2 trilogies, audiences are little more open minded to Dune. It also helps that Dennis had the right balance of passion and critical direction to decide what to keep and remove for this adaptation.


Personally speaking as someone who liked the SW Prequels for their ideas and has been disappointed with the Sequels, Dune felt like a SW film I always wish could exist times 100.

"Exactly. Bond as originally written is a faceless tool of imperialist britain, basically a one man avatar for britain's colonial reign in india, asia and elsewhere. He was an uncritical character who audiences were supposed to cheer for unironically, believing that the foreigners were unquestionably the bad guys and whatever Bond was trying to achieve was the right thing, even if he had to kill dozens of people in cold blood to achieve it.

Craig's Bond has essentially flipped that on its head (at least in some respects), painting Bond as a tired relic of a bygone era who comes to question the moral certitude of his bosses and whether his missions, and the double 0 programme as a whole, are actually the right course of action.

There are still questionable elements to the films, but a pre-Craig Bond would almost certainly not have included >!M creating a super weapon which Bond has to work against MI-6 in order to secure it and prevent a global catastrophe entirely of Britain's own making!< so I commend them for looking for ways to continue the franchise without perpetuating those same tired streotypes.",Exactly Bond originally written faceless tool imperialist britain basically one man avatar britains colonial reign india asia elsewhere uncritical character audiences supposed cheer unironically believing foreigners unquestionably bad guys whatever Bond trying achieve right thing even kill dozens people cold blood achieve Craigs Bond essentially flipped head least some respects painting Bond tired relic bygone era comes question moral certitude bosses whether missions double programme whole actually right course action still questionable elements films preCraig Bond would almost certainly not included M creating super weapon Bond work MI order secure prevent global catastrophe entirely Britains own making so commend looking ways continue franchise without perpetuating same tired streotypes,Negative

"> Sadly some polls make it look like half of this country doesn't plan to go to theaters ever again if they can watch something at home.

I think it's just the natural evolution of entertainment technology and would end up happening, eventually, even without COVID.  It was inevitable and foreseeable.

People have been able to afford bigger and better TVs as the prices have come down over time and Internet streaming capability has also improved.  So why drag yourself to the theater when you can watch in the comfort of your own home on your 65, 75, or 85"" TV with a sound system or premium headphones and pop your own popcorn while sipping your own alcoholic beverages?  You can also pause for bathroom breaks and rewind to watch parts you didn't fully comprehend or great scenes.  If you can project onto a wall, you can watch on a 120"" screen with a $140 native 1080p projector (albeit BrandX).  (I've even seen them on sale for $100.)

I foresee a movie model where you pay money directly to stream new movies similar to what happened with The Green Knight.  The studios might like that as they can cut out the movie theaters that way, assuming they can get a larger cut of the profits from streaming.  They might even set up their own streaming platforms for that very purpose.",Sadly some polls make look like half country doesnt plan go theaters ever can watch something home think just natural evolution entertainment technology would end happening eventually even without COVID inevitable foreseeable People able afford bigger better TVs prices come time Internet streaming capability also improved So drag theater can watch comfort own home TV sound system premium headphones pop own popcorn sipping own alcoholic beverages can also pause bathroom breaks rewind watch parts didnt fully comprehend great scenes can project onto wall can watch screen native p projector albeit BrandX Ive even seen sale foresee movie model pay money directly stream new movies similar happened Green Knight studios might like can cut movie theaters way assuming can get larger cut profits streaming might even set own streaming platforms very purpose,Positive

"I’ve seen quotes from WB execs that SOUND very optimistic about getting a second movie, one even suggesting it is all but certain unless there was a total financial collapse of film. And I have to imagine they’re seeing great numbers in streaming considering how many people I know have only seen it that way who may have gone to a theater if it wasn’t available to stream and still with many people uncomfortable with a packed theater considering the pandemic. I’ve done my part! Uh.. 5… times.. so far. Streaming as soon as available, twice with different friends who don’t have great home theater setups, a 4dx show out of curiosity (first and last time I’ll go to a 4dx theater, that was a mistake) and of course Imax. Hopefully the ticket pace won’t drop off too fast, it’s looking like at least most IMAX shows in my area are close to full theaters through next weekend.

I think some of why these opening numbers are being seen as a notable success is that some of the concerns I heard were that non fans wouldn’t go at all (clearly they are, and most seem to follow it fine and enjoy it) and that Villeneuve’s previous films were very.. lukewarm financially. I wish the expectation for movies with larger budgets to make many multiples in profit to be seen as a success since there is a great deal of room for many great movies that aren’t “easy” and made to appeal to the broadest possible audience, but that’s where we are.

High concept is something that can be explained in a short phrase. You can't really do that to Dune.


Edit since people tend to disagree, from Wikipedia:


High concept is a type of artistic work that can be easily pitched with a succinctly stated premise. It can be contrasted with low concept, which is more concerned with character development and other subtleties that are not as easily summarized. 

The term is often applied to films that are pitched and developed almost entirely upon an engaging premise with broad appeal, rather than standing upon complex character study, cinematography, or other strengths that relate more to the artistic execution of a production.",Yes thats would consider lowconcept scifi High concept something can explained short phrase cant really Dune Edit since people tend disagree Wikipedia High concept type artistic work can easily pitched succinctly stated premise can contrasted low concept more concerned character development other subtleties not easily summarized term often applied films pitched developed almost entirely upon engaging premise broad appeal rather than standing upon complex character study cinematography other strengths relate more artistic execution production,Positive

"Most years there's one film that really blindsides me with its creativity, its originality and the implied hard work and passion of its creators. This year that film was Hundreds of Beavers.

  
You could describe it as a live action collection of Looney Tunes skits but that would be underplaying it.

"Nr. 24.

(Yeah, it released on Netflix worldwide yesterday, January 1st, 2025, but it released in theaters here in Norway on October 30th, 2024.)

I was a little pessimistic after finding Quisling: The Final Days disappointing. But the reviews being even better than that movie slightly raised my expectations. And I was in for a surprise.

Nr. 24 tells the story of Gunnar Sønsteby, one of Norway's foremost WWII resistance fighters, and one I think may have lived the longest, as he died at the age of 94 in 2012.

For many years until he passed away, he toured Norway telling his life story to schools across the country. The movie uses this as the framing device, to ingenious effect, as an old Sønsteby (wonderfully played by Eirik Hivju) tells his life story to a school in Rjukan, where he was born and grew up.

When WWII started, he was only in his 20's (here played by Sjur Vatne Brean for the majority of the movie, as it mostly takes p), and an accountant. Soon he joined the resistance, and as the ware waged on, he became one of the Nazis' most wanted men, which would cost him dearly. The movie mainly focuses on this: Sønsteby during WWII, some of the major missions he took on, and what it cost him.

Without going too much into detail, the framing device features a student in the audience who's a bit more interested in him than the rest of the school, and I'll keep it to her and her questions essentially flipping the movie on its head.

The first half is a little so so, as a lot of it is depicted in Max Manus: Man of War (as both Max Manus and Gunnar Sønsteby were basically the front men of WWII resistance Norway, as part of The Oslo Gang), but the back half with the little framing device twist is what *makes* that movie.

I would really urge you to watch it on Netflix ASAP. To me, this is where the bar is currently set.",Nr Yeah released Netflix worldwide yesterday January st released theaters Norway October th little pessimistic finding Quisling Final Days disappointing reviews even better than movie slightly raised expectations surprise Nr tells story Gunnar Snsteby one Norways foremost WWII resistance fighters one think may lived longest died age many years passed away toured Norway telling life story schools across country movie uses framing device ingenious effect old Snsteby wonderfully played Eirik Hivju tells life story school Rjukan born grew WWII started only s played Sjur Vatne Brean majority movie mostly takes p accountant Soon joined resistance ware waged became one Nazis most wanted men would cost dearly movie mainly focuses Snsteby WWII some major missions took cost Without going too much detail framing device features student audience whos bit more interested than rest school Ill keep questions essentially flipping movie head first half little so so lot depicted Max Manus Man War Max Manus Gunnar Snsteby basically front men WWII resistance Norway part Oslo Gang back half little framing device twist makes movie would really urge watch Netflix ASAP bar currently set,Positive

It blew me away in every regard. Perfectly adapted the stage production, looked and sounded amazing, and had an emotional story that brought me tears and chills several times. The film was also perfectly cast, with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo of course being the standouts. They gave their all to their performances and made me believe in the land of Oz.

Obviously I’m no cinephile and I haven’t seen some more obscure films like Hundreds of Beavers or Memoir of a Snail. These might be better crafted movies than the big budget blockbuster that is Wicked, but of the movies I saw this year, I had the best overall experience with it.",might basic answer favorite film year Wicked huge musical theater fan saw Wicked Broadway first time past spring so cautiously optimistic movie blew away every regard Perfectly adapted stage production looked sounded amazing emotional story brought tears chills several times film also perfectly cast Ariana Grande Cynthia Erivo course standouts gave performances made believe land Oz Obviously Im no cinephile havent seen some more obscure films like Hundreds Beavers Memoir Snail might better crafted movies than big budget blockbuster Wicked movies saw year best overall experience,Positive

"""The Remarkable Life of Ibelin"" (or just ""Ibelin"" on IMDB) absolutely broke me. 

It's a documentary about  Mats Steen, a Norwegian man who died in 2014 of a degenerative muscular disease. The disease was progressive and by his teens he was wheelchair bound, his condition just got worse from there. In his adult life he became engrossed in the online RPG World of Warcraft, which saddened his family as he withdrew from them. However, Mats left them his login info for the game when he died...

His parents decided to log in and post a message on his account about his passing... they were immediately flooded with Mats' online friends reaching out with their condolences and stories of online friendship. The family digs into his account and discovers that Mats was not simply gaming, but living a very rich and fulfilling life in the game where he was not limited by his condition. He made many friends, genuinely affected those he cared about and even found love. His online community mostly had no knowledge of his real life condition.

I cried multiple times, but absolutely bawled at the end at his funeral when some of his guildmates attended his funeral and the woman that he had a genuine, loving and complicated relationship with was one of his pall barers.

Actually, the list goes all the way up to, not 11, but 25, so check out my blog for details. I usually judge as to whether it has been a good year for cinema by how many films are not on my 25 list that I would also say are really good and there were a lot, but to get back to the topic, my favourite film of 2024 has been discussed at length on here, so i'll go with my second favourite,The Beast.

"I think in general they did the royal house a bit dirty in that the scale of their power never really comes across, you are only told they have a ton of power but this is never really shown directly on screen I feel like. The emperor really comes across as  a weak old man that just happens to be the emperor because everyone says so. I don't think this is particularly on Chris Walken alone, more so the general scenes of the imperial family just showing them in small rooms just talking and never really commanding respect on a large scale you expect from an emperor of such a vast imperium. I could see how having a more charismatic person in the role of the emperor would fix this, but I can also see the idea of Chris Walken's character being old and feeble symbolizing the empire as a whole, an empire that is old, feeble and stuck in its ways. 

For me the biggest miscast was Zendaya, I don't think she is a bad actor at all, and it really didn't spoil the movie, but I really just didn't feel like she fit this role as well as the rest of the cast did. I did like what they did what Chani as a character though, gave her a lot more agency and made her more of her own person as compared to the books. And most importantly have Chani function as a character that signals to the audience that what Paul is doing is just the same wheel of power and abuse turning again, instead of ending up with the situation in which Herbert ended up where readers also started seeing Paul as the Messiah after the first book and he had to write the second book to get his point across (which was then quite negatively received). 

I thought the rest of the casting was absolutely perfect though, so it isn't that Zendaya is super bad, just the average one in a group of greats.",think general royal house bit dirty scale power never really comes across only told ton power never really shown directly screen feel like emperor really comes across weak old man just happens emperor everyone says so dont think particularly Chris Walken alone more so general scenes imperial family just showing small rooms just talking never really commanding respect large scale expect emperor such vast imperium could see more charismatic person role emperor would fix can also see idea Chris Walkens character old feeble symbolizing empire whole empire old feeble stuck ways biggest miscast Zendaya dont think bad actor really didnt spoil movie really just didnt feel like fit role well rest cast like Chani character though gave lot more agency made more own person compared books most importantly Chani function character signals audience Paul just same wheel power abuse turning instead ending situation Herbert ended readers also started seeing Paul Messiah first book write second book get point across quite negatively received thought rest casting absolutely perfect though so isnt Zendaya super bad just average one group greats,Positive

"My wife and I agreed that this was a movie we felt had several issues but was somehow one we still loved, and it’s probably one of the best I saw this year despite those issues. I really appreciate the ridiculousness of body horror movies and I think this movie managed to sell its point and maintain its dignity while still allowing itself to get ridiculous and over the top at the end. 

The in-your-face style of the movie helps accomplish this I think, but I do think there were parts that felt receptive or overstayed its welcome. There was a part of me that was really disappointed when the movie didn’t end with (spoilers) Qualley’s character falling apart in epic fashion as she tries to run away from the studio and instead went for another round of mutation and an over-the-top body horror movie ending. I think it would have been really effective, visceral, and memorable while shortening up the movie dramatically. 

But at the same time… when Monstro Elizasue puts on her fucking dress, curls her two hairs, and pins her earring to her head I about lost my mind I was laughing so hard. It’s like the movie really lost me and then pulled me right back into its ridiculousness and left me with a big smile on my face. 

Idk where I sit with the ending fully, and I have other gripes too. Like the fight scene between old hag Elizabeth and Sue feeling like a marvel fight scene with captain America kicks, and too many repetitive scenes in the back half of the movie reiterating how hot Qualley is. It’s a long movie and as hot as she is I think the point was made like 30 boob/ass shots ago. Would help with the runtime.

But still, I came away from this one absolutely loving it.

"I feel that for sure about the ending. It elevated the movie from being some sort of nebulous love triangle to being a much deeper film.

Or both, or none?)... it became about what made each of them happy and what drove them to feeling joyful and engaging in excellence.",feel sure ending elevated movie some sort nebulous love triangle much deeper film wasnt will Art Tashi stay together will switch Patrick none became made each happy drove feeling joyful engaging excellence,Positive
"Here's how I interpreted it: .... SPOILERS BELOW!! ....

If you think about it abstractly, it's about vibrant and dynamic vs faded energy. 

At the beginning, they all love and do well at tennis... their energies are vibrant and dynamic. Tashi at the end of the day loves ""good fucking tennis""--above everything else-- that comes from excellence through passion and working hard, and then the added dynamic of playing with another person who is also passionate and works hard for the game. Tashi knows Patrick and Art are both amazing players who, playing together, keep each other on top of their game. Tashi herself is probably better than both of them, in a league of her own, essentially but still sees them as tennis prodigy equals.

However, Tashi eventually breaks her leg so she can no longer engage in ""good fucking tennis"" herself, but knows she can live vicariously through someone else with an injured body who still can play. It's why she was drawn to Art and wanting to coach him. But things start fading as the years go on. Art loses his passion for the game even if he practices and works hard at it every day. And Patrick, who was the naturally better player who still enjoys playing, just stops focusing and loses his edge by ceasing to work hard at it as he stops playing great competitors. So one has lost his heart for the game and the other has lost his competitiveness. Tashi sees this, especially in Art, as her love for him also begins to fade since he's losing his passion of playing. And she begins to get depressed through this as well, as all 3 players are interconnected. 

And for me, the finale DOES have a definitive ending. The biggest dead weight out of everyone was Art's now current apathy about tennis. And weirdly enough, it was Patrick sleeping with Tashi that lit a fire of anger and frustration in Art, that then re-ignited his passion for playing the game as intensely has he did years before. And that's what Tashi wanted. Good fucking tennis.

No, we don't know what's going to happen with their romantic relationships. Art could leave Tashi even if he wins, due to her cheating. Or he may stay. We don't know that, no. But he has clearly regained his love and edge for playing tennis again, which is a big source of his existential happiness. So he's found that deeper love again. So by the end of the movie, they all have been reactivated to the vibrant, dynamic energy they had at the beginning.",Heres interpreted SPOILERS think abstractly vibrant dynamic vs faded energy beginning love well tennis energies vibrant dynamic Tashi end day loves good fucking tennisabove everything else comes excellence passion working hard added dynamic playing another person also passionate works hard game Tashi knows Patrick Art amazing players playing together keep each other top game Tashi probably better than league own essentially still sees tennis prodigy equals However Tashi eventually breaks leg so can no longer engage good fucking tennis knows can live vicariously someone else injured body still can play drawn Art wanting coach things start fading years go Art loses passion game even practices works hard every day Patrick naturally better player still enjoys playing just stops focusing loses edge ceasing work hard stops playing great competitors So one lost heart game other lost competitiveness Tashi sees especially Art love also begins fade since hes losing passion playing begins get depressed well players interconnected finale definitive ending biggest dead weight everyone Arts now current apathy tennis weirdly enough Patrick sleeping Tashi lit fire anger frustration Art reignited passion playing game intensely years thats Tashi wanted Good fucking tennis No dont know whats going happen romantic relationships Art could leave Tashi even wins due cheating may stay dont know no clearly regained love edge playing tennis big source existential happiness So hes found deeper love So end movie reactivated vibrant dynamic energy beginning,Positive

"I think Chalamet has been cast badly in quiet a few movies, the worst recently being the Charlie and the Chocolate factory, was cringing in the cinema seats, he doesn't fit a goofy character role at all, but in Dune he absolutely isn't one of the bad casts, honestly I wouldn't know a better actor for the role at all. Sure, Cillian Murphy could work, he absolutely has the 'a bit dreamy like' qualities with loads of charisma Paul Atreides would need, but he is simply too old, from the yougner generation of actors Chalamet was imo the perfect choice. Dude absolutely comes across as the slightly autistic (in a good way) 'I can see the future' person I would only see Paul Atreides as, and he fits many of the more serious roles in other movies because of the same reason, dude just looks intelligent and has charisma but just not in a he is a 'goofy and fun guy' way. Although, when I type this I am thinking about his role in 'Don't Look Up' and there he was really one of the highlights comedy wise for me, the 'I am bla bla on Twitch, you game?' line killed me when watching it. I think he is very good at more serious charimatic characters like Paul atreides, and the 'more serious just saying dumb shit' characters, instead of 'funny goofy' characters such as how he portraid Willy Wonka to me. 

Overal, I found him phenomenal as Paul Atreides. I understand your reasons for Zendaya, but I do not think those apply to Chalamet. Paul Atreides needs a 'moody' type of emotion, Paul knows he is going down a path that he as an individual doesn't want to go down to, but he is forced to due to his environment and circumstances, anything other than 'moody' would be weird in those circumstances, he knows the future, he knows what he will do, but that doesn't mean he wants to. Honestly his speech in Dune 2 is one of my favorite speeches in all movies, I still rewatch it regularly on youtube and it still gives me chills.",think Chalamet cast badly quiet few movies worst recently Charlie Chocolate factory cringing cinema seats doesnt fit goofy character role Dune absolutely isnt one bad casts honestly wouldnt know better actor role Sure Cillian Murphy could work absolutely bit dreamy like qualities loads charisma Paul Atreides would need simply too old yougner generation actors Chalamet imo perfect choice Dude absolutely comes across slightly autistic good way can see future person would only see Paul Atreides fits many more serious roles other movies same reason dude just looks intelligent charisma just not goofy fun guy way Although type thinking role Dont Look really one highlights comedy wise bla bla Twitch game line killed watching think very good more serious charimatic characters like Paul atreides more serious just saying dumb shit characters instead funny goofy characters such portraid Willy Wonka Overal found phenomenal Paul Atreides understand reasons Zendaya not think apply Chalamet Paul Atreides needs moody type emotion Paul knows going path individual doesnt want go forced due environment circumstances anything other than moody would weird circumstances knows future knows will doesnt mean wants Honestly speech Dune one favorite speeches movies still rewatch regularly youtube still gives chills,Positive

"Nicholas Barber, BBC: 4/5

> Maybe we should be grateful that Villeneuve didn't choose to make a television series, as that's the fashionable way to adapt novels at the moment, but I wonder if he should have gone the full Lord of the Rings and opted for three parts instead of two. As it is, a film with this scope and richness is a splendid achievement, but it's easier to admire than to love. There is some humanity in there somewhere: at heart it's a coming-of-age story about a boy becoming tougher and more cynical on his way to becoming a leader. But will anyone care about the shallow, po-faced characters? They've got exotic names and elaborate costumes, but none of them has much warmth or personality compared to those in a certain other space opera which I won't mention.

"I watched in yesterday (in German). My thoughts:  

It really is stunningly beautiful. There really is only one word for the cinematography and soundtrack, and that is ""Epic"". The Hans Zimmer score is quite different from what I know, it has a very dark, driving character to it. It fits the movie perfectly. In general the movie is quite gritty.

I was pleasently surprised how close they stayed to the book. One really noticeable change was gender-swapping Liet Kynes (classic Hollywood ...) but otherwise it stayed really faithful to the source.  

If I had to criticize something, it would be that they could have spent a little bit more time on fleshing out some of the important side characters (e.g. we never see or hear Gurney play any songs), and the culture on Arrakis. Especially the normal live in the city Arakeen is never really shown, we only see aerial shots  and the palace. The inhabitants of the city are shown  exactly once. They seemingly decided that having impressive shots of dunes and rocks was more important.  

The runtime is 155 minutes, which is very long but they did a good job with the pacing imo. It never feels boring, although there is not that much action or fighting, but they tell the story in a fairly fast pace.

As someone who is familiar with the books it was a great experience. My friends who aren't familiar with it had some more mixed feelings. 

Personally I would rate it 9/10.",watched yesterday German thoughts really stunningly beautiful really only one word cinematography soundtrack Epic Hans Zimmer score quite different know very dark driving character fits movie perfectly general movie quite gritty pleasently surprised close stayed book One really noticeable change genderswapping Liet Kynes classic Hollywood otherwise stayed really faithful source criticize something would could spent little bit more time fleshing some important side characters eg never see hear Gurney play songs culture Arrakis Especially normal live city Arakeen never really shown only see aerial shots palace inhabitants city shown exactly seemingly decided impressive shots dunes rocks more important runtime minutes very long good job pacing imo never feels boring although not much action fighting tell story fairly fast pace someone familiar books great experience friends arent familiar some more mixed feelings Personally would rate,Positive

So, the adaptation as 3 films shot back to back makes sense, because that’s more or less what the intention for the original novel was. Almost poetic in a sense.

"> But I seriously think they've fucked up badly by not having Part 2 in production already,

It's a numbers game for them. If part 1 tanks, they'd rather only have 160M in the game, instead of however much part 2 is slated to cost. If they put, let's say, 300M on the table for both parts, and part 1 severely underperforms (let's go with 100M), they'd be separated 500M from break even (taking the old ""budget twice = profit"" metric).

With only part 1 in production, if part 1 underperformes with 100M, they are separated 220M from break even (160M * 2 = 320. Then they can say ""ah well, at least we tried, better luck next generation""

"The reason they had so much faith was because it was initially being produced as a two part film by Miramax (I think with a lower budget). Miramax ran into financial difficulties and sold the project (and the development PJ & CO had been doing for ~2 years) to New Line. New Line then looked at all the preproduction work and realized saw how impressive the work WETA, PJ and the concept artists was and upped the budget and moved it to being a trilogy.

 Dune is not a major mainstream franchise and uncertainty around whether they'll actually finish the story they're telling does a lot to dampen enthusiasm and word of mouth for Part 1, and particularly since everyone knew it wouldn't be remotely satisfying on it's own.  Then the 2-3x longer period between films than normal for these sorts of projects will really hurt Part 2's BO even more than it just being a direct sequel already does. 

We'll have to cross our fingers for Dune to get Part 2 greenlit, but I think getting an adaptation of other books done is basically a pipe-dream unless this becomes a surprise hit with the GA and just blows up in popularity.

During that double viewing of Avengers everybody in that room is a major Marvel fan. Not representative of the average Joe and Joanne who you need to get for a box office succes. You can't take 1 room filled with fanboys and assume that's representative of everybody.

Secondly, most people don't have the time for a 4 to 5 hour binge marathon. They take long breaks whenever they want, spend time on their phone during the boring bits and can chill on their own sofa or bed. That's not the same as sitting in a movie theater for 5 hours straight. 

If a director wants to have more than 4 hours for character development they can do a mini series in stead, which people can then binge at their own rate.

And most adults especially over 30 don't have 4 to 5 hours straight to watch a movie or binge a Netflix show.

"Hollywood found out the hard way when they tried to be Broadway with so many bloated roadshow disasters that audiences lost patience with. 

**Plenty** of films have not included every last bit of every bit minutiae of a book, and are still considered classics, because again, they're different mediums. An author can afford to sit you down and spend a whole chapter world building or digressing into a side character's backstory or subplot because 1.) they have to in a non visual medium, and 2.) there's no major budget concerns to worry about. Whatever you're worried about being left out of Dune, what took a bunch of paragraphs to describe in the book will probably come across in one shot in the movie.

And since you brought it up too, film can easily IMPROVE upon source material like your Lord of the Rings example. Tolkien really didn't do much with Boromir in the books, but in the movies he has one of the most effective emotional moments in the entire series. 

Watch Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining that Stephen King didn't like, then check out the version that was more ""faithful"" to the source material that NOBODY liked. Go read the original Godfather books that were nothing all that special, but give it to someone like Francis Ford Coppola and it redefines cinema. Even Chuck Palahniuk likes David Fincher's version of his own story better. I could keep going.

"Two things:
1. Theaters pay their staff hourly, but can only charge customers once per entry for a fixed fee—longer movies do not charge higher admission. Shorter movies are therefore more profitable, and longer movies are less so, especially when we consider consumer resistance to a 3 to 4 hour movie. (Besides, it is well-established most theaters might break even on ticket sales, and profit primarily from concessionary sales.)

2. At some point we have to admit cinema is the incorrect format for telling longer stories. This is clearly what a miniseries on television or streaming would be best at. A classic example is translating the 1100 pages of James Clavell’s “Shōgun” into a 12-hour, 5-part daily miniseries in 1980, with a 3-hour opener, three 2-hr episodes, and a 3-hr closing episode. Absolutely brilliant, critically acclaimed, and more true to the novel.

"If you own a movie theater that’s open from 11am to 11pm, that means you can cram roughly five showings of a 2+ hour movie into those 12 hours. You need, at least, a solid 15-20 minutes to clean/sweep out the theater between screenings. 

Taking a long movie and adding intermissions means you can now only show 3, maybe 4, screenings of that movie. If you’ve got a movie theater with 200-250 seats … at $15-18 per ticket, you’re losing out on $3500 just in ticket sales alone, not to mention concessions, which is the big money maker for theaters. 

So if you go to a longer film screening with an intermission, are you ok with paying a 20-30% higher ticket price to account for the theater losing out one or two showings a day? Would you actually buy concessions during the intermission? 

That’s why the idea of the intermission is dead.",own movie theater thats open pm means can cram roughly five showings hour movie hours need least solid minutes cleansweep theater screenings Taking long movie adding intermissions means can now only show maybe screenings movie youve got movie theater seats per ticket youre losing just ticket sales alone not mention concessions big money maker theaters So go longer film screening intermission ok paying higher ticket price account theater losing one two showings day Would actually buy concessions intermission Thats idea intermission dead,Positive

"Eh, I'm of the opposite to this. I feel most films being released today (especially blockbusters) could actually afford to be cutdown and made tighter.  
For your average film following a three act structure, 90 minutes should be enough time to tell a story effectively. Add another 30 minutes to get the film to 2 hours and that's plenty to have all the nice things the director/ writer wants to include. (As I say 'average film' there are exceptions where a film needs more than 2 hours, but that shouldn't be the default.)

  
Because the problem with giving a director or writer a blank check and just saying 'make the film however long you feel like' you're more likely to end up with poorly paced films that have moments in them for the sake of it. 

To me the ZS Justice League film is the perfect example of why having no time restrictions isn't a good thing. I'm not saying the film was bad, but it did not need to be 4 hours long. Yes it is better than the theatrical version, but things like the multiple slo-mo sequences of Aquaman diving into the ocean just felt like they were there just because Zack shot it and thought it was cool.

  
Limitations can be beneficial for creativity as they can force you to think beyond your first idea and sometimes come up with better ideas.",Eh Im opposite feel most films released today especially blockbusters could actually afford cutdown made tighter average film following three act structure minutes should enough time tell story effectively Add another minutes get film hours thats plenty nice things director writer wants include say average film exceptions film needs more than hours shouldnt default problem giving director writer blank check just saying make film however long feel like youre more likely end poorly paced films moments sake ZS Justice League film perfect example no time restrictions isnt good thing Im not saying film bad not need hours long Yes better than theatrical version things like multiple slomo sequences Aquaman diving ocean just felt like just Zack shot thought cool Limitations can beneficial creativity can force think beyond first idea sometimes come better ideas,Positive

People are fickle. If a movie doesn't play at around the time they want to come see one (right after dinner or whenever they have a window) or if their desired showtime is full because of increased traffic due to the fewer showtimes, that could be all it takes to push them to wait until they can rent it at home cheaper.",Something Im not seeing mentioned logistics Movies made make money Extremely long titles going cut amount showtimes theater can reasonably offer without dipping more screens extending operating hours Kids movies theater perform extremely well market one things boosts numbers can play times span takes run extremely long marvel movie times People fickle movie doesnt play around time want come see one right dinner whenever window desired showtime full increased traffic due fewer showtimes could takes push wait can rent home cheaper,Positive

"Tbh, stories like Dune, LOTR, WoT, etc, are really best told in a TV Series format.  You can slice the story up into seasons, and the episode formula means that you can spend the right amount of time with the characters and the world.

LOTR, for example, should have been a TV show broken out the following way (Assuming 8-10 episodes per season like GoT):

- Season 1 Finale: Finally making it to Rivendell
- Season 2 Finale: Departing Lothlorien (or The breaking of the Fellowship)
- Season 3 Finale: helm’s Deep (this and the next a rough because you have to do Frodo’s journey in tandem with the rest, and can’t really split it the way Tolkien did in the book)
- Season 4 Finale: Shelob + right before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields
- Season 5 Finale: scourging of the shire and the end of the story.

This lets you do several things right:

- It lets you do Pippin looking into the Palantir and Aragorn revealing himself to Sauron at Helm’s Deep properly
- It lets you show the ride to the stone of Erech and the crushing of the black fleet, along with the recruitment of reinforcements from Lossarnach
- It lets you cover the Ents properly, as well as handle The Voice of Saruman much, much better and way less rushed.
- It gives you the freedom to *show* the long journey to Rivendell with proper scale.  
- It lets you devote proper time and attention to the Council of Elrond.
- it lets you set up and handle the Battle of the Pelennor fields properly.
- It lets you handle the final battle at the Black gate better, along with everything leading up to it (Aragorn being a healer in Minas Tirith, the assembling of the forces, and the logic behind marching out to meet Sauron, etc)",Tbh stories like Dune LOTR WoT etc really best told TV Series format can slice story seasons episode formula means can spend right amount time characters world LOTR example should TV show broken following way Assuming episodes per season like GoT Season Finale Finally making Rivendell Season Finale Departing Lothlorien breaking Fellowship Season Finale helms Deep next rough Frodos journey tandem rest cant really split way Tolkien book Season Finale Shelob right Battle Pelennor Fields Season Finale scourging shire end story lets several things right lets Pippin looking Palantir Aragorn revealing Sauron Helms Deep properly lets show ride stone Erech crushing black fleet along recruitment reinforcements Lossarnach lets cover Ents properly well handle Voice Saruman much much better way less rushed gives freedom show long journey Rivendell proper scale lets devote proper time attention Council Elrond lets set handle Battle Pelennor fields properly lets handle final battle Black gate better along everything leading Aragorn healer Minas Tirith assembling forces logic behind marching meet Sauron etc,Positive

">Shorter movies are therefore more profitable, and longer movies are less so, especially when we consider consumer resistance to sit down and watch a 3 to 4 hour movie. (Besides, it is well-established most theaters might break even on ticket sales, and profit primarily from concessionary sales.)

This is precisely true for theaters, but less so for studios. 

The median runtime of movies, since the 1940s has been right around 110 (+/-10) minutes. Comedies tend to be on the shorter end; dramas on the longer.

Movies that exceed this length are ones a studio has to really believe in. Surprisingly, the more recent trend has actually been longer movies— which we might thank Peter Jackson and Marvel for. (But that will only last so long as such movies can pack theaters.)

For people who don’t know, movie distributors and studios take the biggest cut from theater ticket sales in the first week (up to 90%!) which then slides to more favorable terms the longer a movie plays — until on average, it’s a 50/50 split with the exhibitor. That means that theater owners need movies that have “legs” but also can have more showtimes per day, for them to make money.

Studios only need a release to do well in a limited window: the first two weeks.

So it’s actually to the theater’s advantage to have shorter runtimes; but it’s also necessary for such films to continue to have an audience past two weekends.",Shorter movies therefore more profitable longer movies less so especially consider consumer resistance sit watch hour movie Besides wellestablished most theaters might break even ticket sales profit primarily concessionary sales precisely true theaters less so studios median runtime movies since s right around minutes Comedies tend shorter end dramas longer Movies exceed length ones studio really believe Surprisingly more recent trend actually longer movies might thank Peter Jackson Marvel will only last so long such movies can pack theaters people dont know movie distributors studios take biggest cut theater ticket sales first week slides more favorable terms longer movie plays average split exhibitor means theater owners need movies legs also can more showtimes per day make money Studios only need release well limited window first two weeks So actually theaters advantage shorter runtimes also necessary such films continue audience past two weekends,Positive

They’re not spending that much more because the footage is already shot and mostly edited. What’s an extra 10 million on a 200+ million budget? It’s all about runtime. A ticket for a 2 hour film is the same as one for a 3 hour film. If your cinema is open for 15 hours (09-00) allowing an hour between showings you have 5 tickets at 2 hours vs 3-4 for 3 hours.

">So basically just like Broadway shows

Or like an opera.

>Are there examples of famous movies and what their intermission climax was?

Sure.

The best example is *The Bridge on the River Kwai* part one climaxes when Nicholson had won the psychological battle against Saito. It ends right after he learns the Elm bridges of London stood for 600 years. ""600 years...now that would be quite something!""

Then part two begins with Shears in an allied Hospital, and its a new beginning, introducing new characters. Shears becomes the focus instead of Nicholson and the whole thing tips over towards more of an adventure film in the jungle as opposed to the war prisoner drama that was the first part.

The Ten Commandments has a climax for the first part when Moses first sees God and is sent back to Egypt. Part two even starts with a narration that resets the stage. The Godfather was going to have an intermission right after the murder of Sollozzo. Part two would open with that montage of newspaper headlines to recap the story.

With other films its less clear-cut, and its obvious not as much thought went into structuring the film around the intermission: *2001* has its intermission right after HAL sees that the astronauts are conspiring against him, so as to leave the audience on a cliffhanger for part two.",So basically just like Broadway shows like opera examples famous movies intermission climax Sure best example Bridge River Kwai part one climaxes Nicholson psychological battle Saito ends right learns Elm bridges London stood years yearsnow would quite something part two begins Shears allied Hospital new beginning introducing new characters Shears becomes focus instead Nicholson whole thing tips towards more adventure film jungle opposed war prisoner drama first part Ten Commandments climax first part Moses first sees God sent back Egypt Part two even starts narration resets stage Godfather going intermission right murder Sollozzo Part two would open montage newspaper headlines recap story other films less clearcut obvious not much thought went structuring film around intermission intermission right HAL sees astronauts conspiring so leave audience cliffhanger part two,Positive

Lawrence of Arabia's runtime is justified. 

Stalker's runtime is justified.

If the film has a thematic point to it that needs it's runtime to show, then by all means, be long as fuck. Or hell, if the style fits with the runtime, then also go for it. 

For example: Satantango, a seven hour film, is in my opinion absolutely justified with its runtime. Why? Cause it's an art film. It fits the style and pacing you expect from that type of film. 

Does The Suicide Squad need to be 2 hours and 30 minutes? In my opinion, no. You can cut quite a good amount from that movie and not feel like it's affecting the art itself.

My point is that it would be a drop in the bucket in terms of production costs. The reason they won’t do it is that a 2 hour film is more profitable. The LOTR extended editions for example didn’t cost significantly more to produce or else they wouldn’t have released them. It was just so the runtime could be cut down. If they can do it for a dvd release where they don’t make that much money they could easily do it for a theatrical release.,point would drop bucket terms production costs reason wont hour film more profitable LOTR extended editions example didnt cost significantly more produce else wouldnt released just so runtime could cut can dvd release dont make much money could easily theatrical release,Positive

"I love how the theme for Interstellar came to be.  Christopher Nolan went to see Hans Zimmer before he'd even written the script and asked him to compose a theme about a relationship between a father and son (Hans Zimmer has a son, but not a daughter so Nolan switched it up when asking to get the right emotional response from Hans Zimmer). Hans Zimmer wrote this beautiful but rather quiet theme. Nolan then started talking about this epic science fiction movie he wanted to make. Hans Zimmer was a bit confused because he didn't think that the theme he had written was right for the movie Nolan was describing.  Noland told him ""What you've written is the heart"".  I think Nolan getting Zimmer to write the main theme that way was genius.  I think if Zimmer had known was the film was going to be first he might have been more inclined to write different themes for the suspenseful scenes and the emotional scenes.  Instead the whole score is built around that intimate emotional theme that Zimmer wrote and those emotions get infused into the entire movie.",love theme Interstellar came Christopher Nolan went see Hans Zimmer hed even written script asked compose theme relationship father son Hans Zimmer son not daughter so Nolan switched asking get right emotional response Hans Zimmer Hans Zimmer wrote beautiful rather quiet theme Nolan started talking epic science fiction movie wanted make Hans Zimmer bit confused didnt think theme written right movie Nolan describing Noland told youve written heart think Nolan getting Zimmer write main theme way genius think Zimmer known film going first might more inclined write different themes suspenseful scenes emotional scenes Instead whole score built around intimate emotional theme Zimmer wrote emotions get infused entire movie,Positive

A nice, serious, grounded, smart sci-fi movie that does something different from the usual blockbuster formula for once. And the interest I've seen from the general public for Dune 2 hasn't been as big as I expected.

Add to that the increased interest in IMAX since Oppenheimer, with Dune being tailored specifically for it, it’s an additionnal draw for the big screen experience. Let’s not forget that there isn’t much big spectacle in theaters until Dune.

">And now with HBO Max releasing it the same day as theaters, Villeneuve himself has stated the series has already been killed off by the studio's move.

Even without Covid, we were all saying it wasn't going to do well in theaters, and I see no evidence to the contrary (given how poorly these big high-concept sci-fi movies tend to perform, even when they're good and from solid / great directors - see BR2049). They tend to make back their budget and the marketing, with a bit of profit, but almost never enough to launch a franchise and secure (further) sequels.

I think, if anything, the HBOMax thing might help the film. Villeneuve is an artist, and obviously wants his film in theaters, as well as securing the best pay deal for everyone, so is going to be hashing this out with HBOMax. 

But I think anyone who thought it would get a sequel based purely on theatrical performance, even before Covid-19, was deluding themselves IMO.

Even then, that's a sequel, not the entire second half of the story. Who knows what could happen.

"I think part 2 was a shakier proposition, anyway. Dune is a classic, but its a 55 year old classic that is not even remotely as popular today as it was 30 years ago. 

IMO, the real risk isn't the same-day release of the first, or anything COVID related, but purely the reality of the story itself. The story, as originally told, is pretty much the antithesis of everything pumped into western culture in the last 30 years -- its a story where the hero is a wealthy outsider who manipulates the poverty of an oppressed desert-dwelling population to raise up through terrorist actions and start a galaxy-wide Jihad. Spice mumbo-jumbo aside, its practically a biography of Osama Bin Laden, where he's presented as the hero. (OBL was the son of a super-wealth Saudi family, whose wealth was taken by western ""imperial"" powers, fled to the desert where he took advantage of religious beliefs to get revenge for what was done to his family, yadda yadda yadda.)

The story is complex enough as it is, and they're going to have to pick one of two routes -- water down (or change) the underlying story to fit the popular zeitgeist to build popular excitement for people not familiar with the story and alienate all the fans, or tell it as is and risk a box-office flop. 

Given they've already shown that ""jihad"" was replaced with ""crusade"" -- a change that undermines the entire point of the novel -- I suspect its the former. 

In terms of your concern about grand scale, very little of the book has any real grand scale involving large crowds of people, beyond really just the battle at the end of the book. Arakeen is a big city, but very dense without a lot of open spaces. And CGI was sufficient 20 years ago in LoTR to do big battle scenes from a distance. Most of the story is very isolated, very small groups of people, etc, in sietches, etc.",think part shakier proposition anyway Dune classic year old classic not even remotely popular today years ago IMO real risk isnt sameday release first anything COVID related purely reality story story originally told pretty much antithesis everything pumped western culture last years story hero wealthy outsider manipulates poverty oppressed desertdwelling population raise terrorist actions start galaxywide Jihad Spice mumbojumbo aside practically biography Osama Bin Laden hes presented hero OBL son superwealth Saudi family whose wealth taken western imperial powers fled desert took advantage religious beliefs get revenge done family yadda yadda yadda story complex enough theyre going pick one two routes water change underlying story fit popular zeitgeist build popular excitement people not familiar story alienate fans tell risk boxoffice flop Given theyve already shown jihad replaced crusade change undermines entire point novel suspect former terms concern grand scale very little book real grand scale involving large crowds people beyond really just battle end book Arakeen big city very dense without lot open spaces CGI sufficient years ago LoTR big battle scenes distance Most story very isolated very small groups people etc sietches etc,Positive

">without apparently talking to the other studios or people involved in production

My guess is that they'd had their legal people look over some of these contracts and come to the conclusion that the artists and other partners weren't in a strong position to bargain.

It sounds like it's been basically assumed forever that a theatrical-planned film would always go to theaters, so there was no 'if the film goes to internet streaming services prior to 60 days after a theatrical release, the following applies...' clause. Which there should have been, and I blame the agents and guilds for not securing this back when ticket sales at theaters started to slump and Netflix became a major player.

I don't think HBO / Warner went into this blind, but I personally believe the reason for such a big push-back may be because everyone who's looked at their contract knows it's shakey and are trying to scare HBO / Warner into making concessions rather than have to try and pursue legal action that may very well not work.

This is all hypothesis, but I've seen a lot of film production contracts for smaller productions in a job I used to have, and I have **never once** (in my admittedly small circle of experience) seen a clause relating to 'what if it doesn't go to theaters at all' other than when it's a streaming service original production of some sort.

TL;DR My hypothesis is that everyone assumed this was so far off that the punitive clauses in contracts for 'dumping to streaming' weren't very good. HBO / Warner knew this, so did what they did. Everyone else may or may not have a case, but are hoping to force HBO / Warner to backpedal somewhat.",without apparently talking other studios people involved production guess theyd legal people look some contracts come conclusion artists other partners werent strong position bargain sounds like basically assumed forever theatricalplanned film would always go theaters so no film goes internet streaming services prior days theatrical release following applies clause should blame agents guilds not securing back ticket sales theaters started slump Netflix became major player dont think HBO Warner went blind personally believe reason such big pushback may everyone whos looked contract knows shakey trying scare HBO Warner making concessions rather than try pursue legal action may very well not work hypothesis Ive seen lot film production contracts smaller productions job used never admittedly small circle experience seen clause relating doesnt go theaters other than streaming service original production some sort TLDR hypothesis everyone assumed so far punitive clauses contracts dumping streaming werent very good HBO Warner knew so Everyone else may may not case hoping force HBO Warner backpedal somewhat,Positive

"OH shit, sorry, wasn't aware that consensus *300 years from now* was the measuring stick.  Here in the good ol' 20th/21st century, it's universally pretty well regarded.

>Arthur C. Clarke described Dune as ""unique"" and wrote, ""I know nothing comparable to it except Lord of the Rings."" Robert A. Heinlein described the novel as ""powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.""  It was described as ""one of the monuments of modern science fiction"" by the Chicago Tribune, and P. Schuyler Miller called Dune ""one of the landmarks of modern science fiction ... an amazing feat of creation.""  The Washington Post described it as ""a portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than any other author in the field has managed ... a story absorbing equally for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.""  Algis Budrys praised Dune for the vividness of its imagined setting, saying ""The time lives. It breathes, it speaks, and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils"".  After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed Dune as among stories ""that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical"".

Not to mention Hugo/Nebula awards, spawned various film/TV adaptions, games, 20+ million copies sold, I could go on.  The breadth of which is not really feasible from a book that has... 'no reputation'.  I can't imagine any of the WB studio execs / Villeneuve, all the cast, their agents, etc... thinking ""Dune huh?... meh - NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  Hard pass!""

I don't care if you have the greatest marketing team in history, and the biggest budget for such on record...  it ain't gonna do THAT.

Of course, Paul becomes a totally different person once he gains power, you could arguably equate him closer to Anakin than Luke.

But the actual significance to Dune is the writing and concepts and impact it had on sci-fi. Without it we wouldn't have Star Wars or Avatar or whatever else you think is similar.

I've read the whole saga, as it's me all-time favorite sci-fi saga, so I can tell you true that you'd be best to find Children of Dune (reckon they might call it a miniseries; I just call it the long movie). 


Every other movie that's been done of the first book of Dune (as those who did Children, did the first remake of Dune first), blows this new rich prick director's insulting piece of crap off the map.

"> [...] The character of Gurney, played by Josh Brolin, is more than proud to be a soldier of House Atreides and be there for Paul even after pretty much everyone else is dead. Where does this pride in being from this house come from? It isn’t his family. He is just a citizen of their country (planet?). What does Gurney gain by sticking with Paul? What does he have to gain by supporting a young man that the people of the desert think is their messiah? Gurney even goes to show Paul where they keep atomic bombs for his use in war. This doesn’t seem like a thing I would want for religious fanatics to have access to. More weapons equal more power, even in this sci-fi future of the galaxy. Gurney to me is like many people I just don’t understand. Why have blind patriotism? What good does it do? [...]

I agree in general - however, it is made more clear in the books that Gurney feels he has a specific life-debt to House Atreides as they saved him from Harkonnen slave pits. His life was hell, yet the Atreides, rescuing him, saw something in him and raised him up. He becomes an honoured 'Knight' of the House. IMO, he himself would say, ""I am ultimately not a leader, so I must follow - but I will only follow righteousness (and I see it in Leto)."" Gurney is a key figure that bridges the divide between elites of the house and their army of warrior-knights.

>  Gurney even goes to show Paul where they keep atomic bombs for his use in war.

ie. The Atreides trusted Gurney with nukes.

However, if I remember correctly, there is a scene in the book where certain characters look down on Gurney with a sort of haughty pity - as a moulded thing (and to some degree this does reflect Herbert's own thought in general about 'the danger of leaders and non-independent thought'). Gurney is a 'necessary evil'. Gurney is a character reflecting a sort of 'ideal' in the role he plays, which is acknowledged as a role that only needs to exist because 'life is dangerous'. Herbert might say, 'if there *has* to be hierarchy, then make sure you do it properly' (see *God Emperor*). Gurney fits into the House structure 'properly' and served it's needs well, and so it treated him as well as it could.  The meaning of the word 'gurney' (as chosen by Herbert, for the character's name) is telling.

We could judge Gurney (on a different level) for his being driven by vengeance (and this is what ultimately cleaves him to Fremen and becoming bound up with their motivations).",character Gurney played Josh Brolin more than proud soldier House Atreides Paul even pretty much everyone else dead pride house come isnt family just citizen country planet Gurney gain sticking Paul gain supporting young man people desert think messiah Gurney even goes show Paul keep atomic bombs use war doesnt seem like thing would want religious fanatics access More weapons equal more power even scifi future galaxy Gurney like many people just dont understand blind patriotism good agree general however made more clear books Gurney feels specific lifedebt House Atreides saved Harkonnen slave pits life hell yet Atreides rescuing saw something raised becomes honoured Knight House IMO would say ultimately not leader so must follow will only follow righteousness see Leto Gurney key figure bridges divide elites house army warriorknights Gurney even goes show Paul keep atomic bombs use war ie Atreides trusted Gurney nukes However remember correctly scene book certain characters look Gurney sort haughty pity moulded thing some degree reflect Herberts own thought general danger leaders nonindependent thought Gurney necessary evil Gurney character reflecting sort ideal role plays acknowledged role only needs exist life dangerous Herbert might say hierarchy make sure properly see God Emperor Gurney fits House structure properly served needs well so treated well could meaning word gurney chosen Herbert characters name telling could judge Gurney different level driven vengeance ultimately cleaves Fremen becoming bound motivations,Positive
"> Dune: Part 1 doesn’t quite feel like a full story


I guess that makes sense give that it's the first half of the book. 


I enjoyed both movies, but have watched the second part several more times as it progresses more of the story. 


The book is quite different from the movie. The Fremen women have no significant roles. Paul meets Chain and they have some kids and after she's not much involved in the story. and there's no split of religious thought, every Fremen believes. 


> Where does this pride in being from this house come from?


It's not blind patriotism. It's a feudal universe. He's sworn to serve House Atreides. ",Dune Part doesnt quite feel like full story guess makes sense give first half book enjoyed movies watched second part several more times progresses more story book quite different movie Fremen women no significant roles Paul meets Chain some kids shes not much involved story theres no split religious thought every Fremen believes pride house come not blind patriotism feudal universe Hes sworn serve House Atreides,Positive

"DUNE as two movies has to be rushed. Even the sandworms are almost supersonic :)

The books are full of internal monologue and so it's really difficult to present the entire thing visually. I do think the movies are masterful, but sadly there is much that is left entirely implicit, that could have perhaps been worked in, one way or another. The true importance and mechanism of Spice itself, even. 

The complete omission of the thread of 'Thinking Machines' and how they shaped the ethos of the people was very ... interesting, given the current 'rise of AI' (granted, the timeline has the culture very far after the banning of AI, so it's sort of unspoken and taken for granted by that point).

As one who read the books before the movies, I love the movies as a sort of lengthy music video that accompanies all the ideas in my head from the books. I can imagine the non-reader audience's overall impression of the 'universe' of the story as presented by the movie is very different from the book reader - but the movies ultimately present the overarching story very well, and very compactly.",DUNE two movies rushed Even sandworms almost supersonic books full internal monologue so really difficult present entire thing visually think movies masterful sadly much left entirely implicit could perhaps worked one way another true importance mechanism Spice even complete omission thread Thinking Machines shaped ethos people very interesting given current rise AI granted timeline culture very far banning AI so sort unspoken taken granted point one read books movies love movies sort lengthy music video accompanies ideas head books can imagine nonreader audiences overall impression universe story presented movie very different book reader movies ultimately present overarching story very well very compactly,Positive

9. Challengers (I had no interest in this. But this almost made it to my favorites. Stellar acting. Especially from zendaya. It also dripped with sexiness but never felt raunchy. And that soundtrack is amazing. Also that ending still gives me chills)

"I'm going to sound crazy, but hear me out: Megalopolis. There are a few reasons why. 

1.) I always admire when a director takes a big swing. And Coppola took a MASSIVE swing with this movie. Sadly for him, the ball went flying by and his swing didn't make any sort of contact. But I can't help but admire the ambition and artistry on display. 

2.) While I certainly saw movies better than it this year, none of them entertained me quite the same way. Megalopolis is fucking insanity. Genuinely one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen on a movie screen. Didn't even make sense. But it was bizarre in a weirdly captivating way. 

3.)

"Since no one is actually giving you debate points outside of: ""no, you're wrong. end of discussion."" I'll entertain this/

Dune in its purest form is a story that is anti-action/lone hero to save us all and how it is dangerous to have messiah type individuals in the world. How power in all forms ends with human suffering and suffering ends up with more violence. Messiah stories are built with cruel intentions that lead to more violence as the people making those stories are often pushing a narrative: in Dune's case- Bene Gesserit. 

Timotee Chalamet or Paul shouldn't look like a warrior. He's a prince that was thrusted into a world.

Paul's initial intention is very well known -- he just wants revenge for the death of his father, who was a just man with pure intentions.However - again -- Dune paints that everything is a catch 22. Paul's success in the field only plays into the stories that were transferred around Fremen. When Paul drinks the liquid -- he sees the outcome and sees the best path forward. Again whether it was done well enough in the first movie or potentially explained in the future movie --- his visions are not always true? He kills the guy that he thought was going to train him in the desert. Or is the liquid just similar to someone dropping acid? Or can he really tell the future? Arent these all the same characteristics of the ongoing debate on any religious figure? --- That's the set up for a messiah character. 

Knowing that - Paul doesn't look like a typical action hero -- but think about all the cult leaders or religious figures that we know in the world -- they all are similar to Paul - unassuming warriors who fit a narrative or a story. Not a buff solider. Not a Josh Brolin's character. Ironically -- Lawerence of Arabia has a similar out of place character who acts as a leader. 

I actually do agree with you on the chemistry between TC and Zendaya -- but I think it was a risk that Denis took -- because the love story is not really the purpose of Zendaya. her character represents the voice of pointing the bullshit -- TC wants a holy war for power or revenge or some bullshit vision. Home girl fell in love with him because they wanted this planet and the people to be safe and free. Who gives a fuck about some myth -- they can form their own destiny. She represents that viewpoint. 

Zendaya not looking like a weathered soldier is intentional. Again - if you're compelled to fight for your land or your people -- I think the people who end up fighting the ""empire"" do not look like soldiers. She is out of place and it is intentional. But then again - she is a beautiful actress -- and it will be hard to tone that down. And if she's the love interest -- yah -- i get it. 

I never read the books -- these are just make takes on it.",Since no one actually giving debate points outside no youre wrong end discussion Ill entertain Dune purest form story antiactionlone hero save us dangerous messiah type individuals world power forms ends human suffering suffering ends more violence Messiah stories built cruel intentions lead more violence people making stories often pushing narrative Dunes case Bene Gesserit Timotee Chalamet Paul shouldnt look like warrior Hes prince thrusted world Pauls initial intention very well known just wants revenge death father just man pure intentionsHowever Dune paints everything catch Pauls success field only plays stories transferred around Fremen Paul drinks liquid sees outcome sees best path forward whether done well enough first movie potentially explained future movie visions not always true kills guy thought going train desert liquid just similar someone dropping acid can really tell future Arent same characteristics ongoing debate religious figure Thats set messiah character Knowing Paul doesnt look like typical action hero think cult leaders religious figures know world similar Paul unassuming warriors fit narrative story Not buff solider Not Josh Brolins character Ironically Lawerence Arabia similar place character acts leader actually agree chemistry TC Zendaya think risk Denis took love story not really purpose Zendaya character represents voice pointing bullshit TC wants holy war power revenge some bullshit vision Home girl fell love wanted planet people safe free gives fuck some myth can form own destiny represents viewpoint Zendaya not looking like weathered soldier intentional youre compelled fight land people think people end fighting empire not look like soldiers place intentional beautiful actress will hard tone shes love interest yah get never read books just make takes,Positive

"Walken was awful casting to me and completely took me out of the film.  
  
There are a lot of strengths and a few big shortcomings to Dune... I think the actors were fine and at that level shouldn't be blamed since they are often chosen to fit a screenplay and edited into oblivion. If they suck they just don't get work again and those measures are a world onto themself. 

I think the issue was the screenplay if not even the original story. It really is an impossible/difficult book/story to make into a film and as well as it could / has now be done there's a lot of lack that makes it feel rough to some people.

I enjoy the Dune movies but the second confirmed for me that they're realistic within a scope and as far as Denis has made them I relate them to the Star Wars prequels and just think they're action/sci-fi flicks with superficial drama on-top. The problem is they take themselves too seriously and focus too much on shallow reflections of deep ideas rather than what people actually enjoy about the story worlds.",Walken awful casting completely took film lot strengths few big shortcomings Dune think actors fine level shouldnt blamed since often chosen fit screenplay edited oblivion suck just dont get work measures world onto themself think issue screenplay not even original story really impossibledifficult bookstory make film well could now done theres lot lack makes feel rough some people enjoy Dune movies second confirmed theyre realistic within scope far Denis made relate Star Wars prequels just think theyre actionscifi flicks superficial drama ontop problem take too seriously focus too much shallow reflections deep ideas rather than people actually enjoy story worlds,Positive

">When Paul drinks the liquid -- he sees the outcome and sees the best path forward. Again whether it was done well enough in the first movie or potentially explained in the future movie --- his visions are not always true? He kills the guy that he thought was going to train him in the desert. Or is the liquid just similar to someone dropping acid? Or can he really tell the future?

This was explained in both movies, albeit some parts were from single lines of dialogue so if you missed a few seconds here and there you might be out of the loop.

Paul is born with psychic powers because his mother Jessica comes from a long line of space witches who have been breeding for generations. He can see fragments of all possible futures. When he first consumes spice it amplifies this effect and he can see more, however his visions are still not clear as he is still seeing only fragments. The Water of Life is basically super concentrated spice and when he takes it his powers of future sight become fully activated and he can see all possible futures clearly. When he tells Jessica that he sees a narrow path to his family's survival he has looked at all the possible futures and found the one in which his choices lead to their safety, but in turn it means he must embrace his role as Lisan Al Gaib and lead the Fremen to a holy war across the galaxy.",Paul drinks liquid sees outcome sees best path forward whether done well enough first movie potentially explained future movie visions not always true kills guy thought going train desert liquid just similar someone dropping acid can really tell future explained movies albeit some parts single lines dialogue so missed few seconds might loop Paul born psychic powers mother Jessica comes long line space witches breeding generations can see fragments possible futures first consumes spice amplifies effect can see more however visions still not clear still seeing only fragments Water Life basically super concentrated spice takes powers future sight become fully activated can see possible futures clearly tells Jessica sees narrow path familys survival looked possible futures found one choices lead safety turn means must embrace role Lisan Al Gaib lead Fremen holy war across galaxy,Positive

"Transcript of Will Smith's Speech, for anyone interested: 

Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.

Making this film I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who is one of the most strongest, most delicate people I ever met. I got to protect Saniyya and Demi, the two actresses that played Venus and Serena. I’m being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people.

I know to do what we do, you gotta be able to take abuse, and you gotta be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business, you gotta be able to have people disrespecting you and you gotta smile and you gotta pretend like that’s OK.

But Richard Williams, and what I loved, thank you D. Denzel (Washington) said to me a few minutes ago, he said, “At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you.”

It’s like I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena.

I just spit, I hope they didn’t see that.

I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That’s what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern.

I want to apologize to the Academy, I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees, I can't tell you how much I say from the bottom of my heart I'm so very, very sorry.

I pride myself and think of myself as a man of faith - as there's a drive into deep left field by Castellanos that will be a home run. And so that will make it a 4-0 ballgame. I don't know if I'm gonna be putting on this headset again. I don't know if it's gonna be for the Reds. I don't know if it's gonna be for my bosses at Fox. I want to apologize for the people who sign my paycheck - for the Reds, for Fox Sports Ohio, for the people I work with, for anybody that I've offended here tonight. I can't begin to tell you how deeply sorry I am. That is not who I am. It never has been. And I'd like to think maybe I could have some people ... that could back that up. I am very, very sorry, and I beg for your forgiveness.

"Essentially, it is because there are very few shields actually being used in Dune 2, for a variety of reasons.

It is explained in Dune 1 that using a shield is a death sentence in the deserts of Arrakis, because it attracts sandworms and drives them into a frenzy. Therefore Fremen don't use shields at all, and neither do any non-suicidal Harkonnen or Atreides forces when they venture into the deep desert.

In Dune 1 we see lots of shields because most of the combat occurs in the Harkonnen's assault on Arrakeen, which takes place in the city of Arrakeen (between Atreides, Harkonnen and Sardaukar forces, all of whom use shields as part of their standard military equipment). Arrakeen is located in a rock basin protected by the ""Shield Wall"" mountain range, where sandworms cannot threaten anyone, so in Arrakeen shields are in full use.

We barely see anyone using shields for most of Dune 2 because most of the plot revolves around the Fremen and most of the combat occurs in the deep desert, where wearing a shield is a death sentence. The Fremen don't wear shields, nor do the Harkonnens in the desert, except on their ornithopters.

We do see some shield effects when Feyd-Rautha is fighting on Geidi Prime, but since the black sun makes everything look monochrome, the shield effects look black rather than blue/red.

EDIT: Also in the final battle of Dune 2, the Sardaukar camped in the Arrakeen basin would probably have shields equipped, but during that battle the shields of most of the troops on the surface are being shorted out and nullified by the enormous sandstorm which Paul had allowed into the Arrakeen basin when he nuked the Shield Wall mountains (just as he predicted and planned). On the other hand, in the fight that occurs away from the sandstorm down in the streets of Arrakeen when Gurney Halleck and the Fremen are assaulting the Harkonnen forces there, the Harkonnen troops have functional shields and we can see the blue and red effects just like we did in Dune 1.",Essentially very few shields actually used Dune variety reasons explained Dune using shield death sentence deserts Arrakis attracts sandworms drives frenzy Therefore Fremen dont use shields neither nonsuicidal Harkonnen Atreides forces venture deep desert Dune see lots shields most combat occurs Harkonnens assault Arrakeen takes place city Arrakeen Atreides Harkonnen Sardaukar forces use shields part standard military equipment Arrakeen located rock basin protected Shield Wall mountain range sandworms cannot threaten anyone so Arrakeen shields full use barely see anyone using shields most Dune most plot revolves around Fremen most combat occurs deep desert wearing shield death sentence Fremen dont wear shields nor Harkonnens desert except ornithopters see some shield effects FeydRautha fighting Geidi Prime since black sun makes everything look monochrome shield effects look black rather than bluered EDIT Also final battle Dune Sardaukar camped Arrakeen basin would probably shields equipped battle shields most troops surface shorted nullified enormous sandstorm Paul allowed Arrakeen basin nuked Shield Wall mountains just predicted planned other hand fight occurs away sandstorm streets Arrakeen Gurney Halleck Fremen assaulting Harkonnen forces Harkonnen troops functional shields can see blue red effects just like Dune,Positive

"Iirc the shields protect against fast movement and have a blindspot to slow movement, which is why hand to hand combat is a thing vs projectile weaponry.

However the choice of colors follow Doppler shifts, where red is a decrease in energy and frequency and occurs when slower shield defeating strikes land, and blue which absorbs and spreads the faster strike is an increase in energy and frequency. I assume that's what the director wanted it to mean.",Iirc shields protect fast movement blindspot slow movement hand hand combat thing vs projectile weaponry blue red colors tell audience happening never directly addressed colors characters could not colored inuniverse However choice colors follow Doppler shifts red decrease energy frequency occurs slower shield defeating strikes land blue absorbs spreads faster strike increase energy frequency assume thats director wanted mean,Negative

"The main comment here absolutely nails it, but I do want to clarify how the shields work. It isn't blue for block and red for fatal kill, the shields stop ALL velocity movement above a certain range (blue is shield activating). This is why firearms aren't in use for the cities but rampant in fremen society (think they were called maula pistols?) where shields aren't used.

The red effects are only really there for audience visualization of what is happening, when an attack is slow enough to penetrate the field. Functionally speaking in-world the shield wouldn't detect when it is penetrated. This is why it is a short blade weapon society (and the shield busters from space being blocked until it loses enough speed to get through) and not things like maces/longswords, you control the stabbing speed to penetrate the shield once you've slipped the opponent's guard, which is what makes ultra-trained soldiers like the Fremen and Saurdakar (and the upcoming troops of the Atreides, part of why the Emperor turned on them) so deadly and feared.",main comment absolutely nails want clarify shields work isnt blue block red fatal kill shields stop velocity movement certain range blue shield activating firearms arent use cities rampant fremen society think called maula pistols shields arent used red effects only really audience visualization happening attack slow enough penetrate field Functionally speaking inworld shield wouldnt detect penetrated short blade weapon society shield busters space blocked loses enough speed get not things like maceslongswords control stabbing speed penetrate shield youve slipped opponents guard makes ultratrained soldiers like Fremen Saurdakar upcoming troops Atreides part Emperor turned so deadly feared,Negative
"Take it up with Liet-Kynes, who literally says so in Dune Part 1.

>""A shield's a death sentence in the desert. It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy.""

Anyway, thumpers are activated and then left at some distance in order to call the worm to the thumper instead of your own location. Even when calling a worm to ride, you don't just put the thumper at your feet and stand there, you position yourself so that you can hook onto the worm as it goes by. 

By contrast, an active personal shield would be on you at all times, and the worm would come straight for you, while frenzied. The effect of the shield on the worm is more potent than a thumper, so it might even summon multiple worms even though they usually stay away from each other.",Take LietKynes literally says so Dune Part shields death sentence desert attracts worms drives killing frenzy Anyway thumpers activated left some distance order call worm thumper instead own location Even calling worm ride dont just put thumper feet stand position so can hook onto worm goes contrast active personal shield would times worm would come straight frenzied effect shield worm more potent than thumper so might even summon multiple worms even though usually stay away each other,Positive
"It is stated multiple times that the worms are attracted to the shield, driven into a killing frenzy that causes them to ignore territorial borders. This would not be repeated by the residents of the planet if not also confirmed by the government. Duh, of course you'd want to put shields on your spice extractor if it wasn't already proven to be suicide.

A thumper is a simple device that thumps. Worms are attracted to vibrations, so the implication is that the field a shield emits to work has some kind of vibrational aspect that worms can detect MUCH easier and further than a simple thumper.

You drop a thumper, you're getting eventually one worm. You turn on a shield in the open desert, you're getting EVERY WORM in the possible radius coming at max speed.",stated multiple times worms attracted shield driven killing frenzy causes ignore territorial borders would not repeated residents planet not also confirmed government Duh course youd want put shields spice extractor wasnt already proven suicide thumper simple device thumps Worms attracted vibrations so implication field shield emits work some kind vibrational aspect worms can detect MUCH easier than simple thumper drop thumper youre getting eventually one worm turn shield open desert youre getting EVERY WORM possible radius coming max speed,Positive
"The way it's described in the book is that if a lasgun and shield interact both the shield and lasgun are destroyed. They say on the low end it might just kill both the individual users or could be large enough to rival atomics. Exactly what influences the size of the blast isn't ever delved into fully.

What seems to have become the standard in the Dune universe is shields are used everywhere all the time and as a result lasguns are almost never used because it's too dangerous. During the Harkonnen/Saudakar assault they caught the Atredies a bit off guard using ornithopters and troops armed with lasguns to pursue any survivors that made it out of the city because they knew it would be safe to use them in the desert.

I think it's Duncan if I remember correctly who improvises and sets up a shield covering his retreat at one point and tricks the pursuing Saudakar into hitting it with a lasgun. The explosion is quite large and Paul says something like, ""You set up a shield. A big one."" So it kind of implies that the bigger the shield the bigger the blast, in the first book at least, but as I said they never explicitly say what can influence the size.",way described book lasgun shield interact shield lasgun destroyed say low end might just kill individual users could large enough rival atomics Exactly influences size blast isnt ever delved fully seems become standard Dune universe shields used everywhere time result lasguns almost never used too dangerous HarkonnenSaudakar assault caught Atredies bit guard using ornithopters troops armed lasguns pursue survivors made city knew would safe use desert think Duncan remember correctly improvises sets shield covering retreat one point tricks pursuing Saudakar hitting lasgun explosion quite large Paul says something like set shield big one So kind implies bigger shield bigger blast first book least said never explicitly say can influence size,Positive

My point is that YouTube (and channels like it like Facebook, Twitter, etc.) reward success. If an ad is performing exceptionally well, those channels will push it to more people.

This will typically have the channel (like YouTube) push that video more organically (and organic is also *free*) as well since these platforms want popular content to become even more popular.

"> I’m a little unsure what your point is.

Someone asked why the mini-preview can't be a separate video from the main video, so that people viewing the video directly don't have to see the pointless mini-preview for the video they are watching.

You replied ""cos metrics!""

My point is that that it is very possible (and I realise it is not a small change, but it is possible nonetheless) for Youtube to allow uploaders to have the main video and the preview video to be different entities but combine their metrics within the same ""video"" so that everyone gets the best of both worlds. Real ads can run the preview, people viewing the main trailer directly can skip the preview, and the stats are all viewable by the agency within the same ""video"".

It would not change how videos are promoted, organically or otherwise. The only change is that people viewing the video directly won't have to sit through the ad for the video they are currently trying to watch.",Im little unsure point Someone asked minipreview cant separate video main video so people viewing video directly dont see pointless minipreview video watching replied cos metrics point very possible realise not small change possible nonetheless Youtube allow uploaders main video preview video different entities combine metrics within same video so everyone gets best worlds Real ads can run preview people viewing main trailer directly can skip preview stats viewable agency within same video would not change videos promoted organically otherwise only change people viewing video directly wont sit ad video currently trying watch,Positive

"And yet, many trailers in the 70s, 80s, 90s were still basically giving a plot summary. Psycho was a pretty special case, and Hitchcock even went around buying up copies of the book so people wouldn't learn the ending. And certainly there are other cases where filmmakers wanted to avoid spoilers.

But spoiler aversion (not just mere avoidance, but a hostile antipathy towards them) in audiences, to where you hear constant complains about them, is a relatively new phenomenon.

And not having spoilers is often a bad thing. *Romeo and Juliet* rather famously opens by saying ""a pair of star-crossed lovers do with their death bury their parents' strife"". The thing about romance stories is that audiences usually get quite upset if the leads don't get together at the end... unless it's established early on that they won't so the audience knows what to expect.

Managing expectations is just as important in storytelling as it is elsewhere and if things don't play out as expected, the audience must be prepped beforehand. Spoiler aversion on the other hand leads to ""subverting expectations"".",yet many trailers s s s still basically giving plot summary Psycho pretty special case Hitchcock even went around buying copies book so people wouldnt learn ending certainly other cases filmmakers wanted avoid spoilers spoiler aversion not just mere avoidance hostile antipathy towards audiences hear constant complains relatively new phenomenon not spoilers often bad thing Romeo Juliet rather famously opens saying pair starcrossed lovers death bury parents strife thing romance stories audiences usually get quite upset leads dont get together end unless established early wont so audience knows expect Managing expectations just important storytelling elsewhere things dont play expected audience must prepped beforehand Spoiler aversion other hand leads subverting expectations,Positive

I took issue with you giving Venom a 2/10 when it came out, but subsequently giving the last maze runner movie a much higher score. I outlined why the maze runner ending invalidated the whole series, and thus left the whole movie completely flat (of course personal taste is a thing, but still). 

So my question is similar. In previous years you seemed to think that marvel movies were getting entirely formulaic, and rating them rather low. This year however a lot of them scored higher on your list. I have NOT seen The Eternals yet, but I’ve been told that it breaks away from the previous marvel mold, is less focused on superhero action and more on the story. You rated it 5/10 though, so have I been mislead with what I’ve been told? Or is it something along the lines of the other marvel movies just did a much better job of breaking away from the mold this time? I would really be interested in your take. The Eternals was a movie I was highly anticipating because it was billed as “different”.",asked question year two ago didnt respond Theres fewer comments time so hopefully youre willing give one look took issue giving Venom came subsequently giving last maze runner movie much higher score outlined maze runner ending invalidated whole series thus left whole movie completely flat course personal taste thing still So question similar previous years seemed think marvel movies getting entirely formulaic rating rather low year however lot scored higher list NOT seen Eternals yet Ive told breaks away previous marvel mold less focused superhero action more story rated though so mislead Ive told something along lines other marvel movies just much better job breaking away mold time would really interested take Eternals movie highly anticipating billed different,Positive

"NOT OP: I do subscribe to the idea that no movie is perfect, and Dune is no exception. But seriously, as a very faithful adaptation of a beloved novel I think it's as close to a 10/10 as you're likely to get on the silver screen. 

Dune (the novel) packs in so much exposition and so much focus on the inner mind of its characters that it really is almost unfilmable as a straight book-to-movie. Few movies are. The only movie I can come up with that succeeds there is the Shawshank Redemption. 

And here's the thing; where Dune (novel) was not packing in the exposition and history, it was almost describing the worlds and particularly Arrakis as one would write a travelogue. Turning that into something that can engage the audience at all let alone for 2 hours is a mammoth undertaking in itself, and I think that they nailed it.

It also happened to be a good movie even for someone not familiar with the source. It was self-contained enough to not need a deep understanding of the world to follow what was going on. The emperor's motivations were opaque in this movie, but that's also something in the source material and will probably be explored in future parts. Jackson's Lord of the Rings did the same; opening up the material to a new audience. Sales of the book have increased quite substantially in the months preceding and succeeding the release of the movie. I think that can be classed as a great success.",NOT OP subscribe idea no movie perfect Dune no exception seriously very faithful adaptation beloved novel think close youre likely get silver screen Dune novel packs so much exposition so much focus inner mind characters really almost unfilmable straight booktomovie Few movies only movie can come succeeds Shawshank Redemption heres thing Dune novel not packing exposition history almost describing worlds particularly Arrakis one would write travelogue Turning something can engage audience let alone hours mammoth undertaking think nailed also happened good movie even someone not familiar source selfcontained enough not need deep understanding world follow going emperors motivations opaque movie thats also something source material will probably explored future parts Jacksons Lord Rings same opening material new audience Sales book increased quite substantially months preceding succeeding release movie think can classed great success,Positive

For the **Maze Runner** score of 5/10 in 2018, I honestly had no investment in the film or book series as a whole (I don't even think I saw the 2nd movie and I never read the books), so I guess the ending didn't affect me as much, I watch something like that more as a standalone thing, and I remember thinking it was just another okay/average YA-action film, nothing more nothing less. On the other hand, I don't remember if I reviewed **Venom** or not but that movie made me actively angry, like my intelligence was being insulted every 5 minutes. It was just a non-stop series of boring edgy one-liners. I don't like Tom Hardy's casting, I didn't like his relationship with Michelle Williams' character, all of the dialogue sucked, and the villain(s) sucked. It was an awkward experience overall. I actually thought the 2nd one was okay though. I'd watch **Maze Runner** over the original **Venom** any day of the week.

"You're going to get a load of really sneery Reddit dude replies to this, so allow me to provide the explanation for a big part of its success that the sub seems curiously blind to.

Venom/Eddie have a HUGE following of gay male/women+who+ship+gay+males on sites like Tumblr where they generate a massive amount of jokes, memes, fanart and fanfiction. Those two groups don't *stay* on Tumblr, they just dress differently when they head over to Twitter - where they punch massively above their weight promotionally because when they go all in on something, they do little else. There's a lot of crossover with that fandom demo and stuff like Supernatural and Sherlock, so it's nothing new to them to do that heavy lifting for something they feel an investment in. Those people feel invested in it as an ""underdog"" they adopted, so they're not only going to show up, they're going to give it a lot of organic, money-can't-buy social media penetration.

The ""Monsterfucker"" jokes made Venom a meme with entertainment value the movie itself didn't necessarily justify, and helped turn it into a semi-sleeper hit, but that also means it has more appeal to those people as a fun, communal experience rather than something you sit at home to watch. 

And it incidentally made Venom seem like something more transgressive, less mainstream and more fun-to-like than the MCU, which has by now lost its new car smell to younger ticketbuyers who don't remember a time before it. Simply put it's cooler and funnier to be a Venom fan than a Spiderman one.",Youre going get load really sneery Reddit dude replies so allow provide explanation big part success sub seems curiously blind VenomEddie HUGE following gay malewomenwhoshipgaymales sites like Tumblr generate massive amount jokes memes fanart fanfiction two groups dont stay Tumblr just dress differently head Twitter punch massively weight promotionally go something little else Theres lot crossover fandom demo stuff like Supernatural Sherlock so nothing new heavy lifting something feel investment people feel invested underdog adopted so theyre not only going show theyre going give lot organic moneycantbuy social media penetration Monsterfucker jokes made Venom meme entertainment value movie didnt necessarily justify helped turn semisleeper hit also means more appeal people fun communal experience rather than something sit home watch incidentally made Venom seem like something more transgressive less mainstream more funtolike than MCU now lost new car smell younger ticketbuyers dont remember time Simply put cooler funnier Venom fan than Spiderman one,Positive

Personally I wouldn't count Memento. Leonard isn't a heroic character in any standard sense, he is a man trying to extrajudicially murder bad people for revenge. At the end of the movie we find out another bad person (a corrupt cop) has been manipulating him, and so Leonard gets revenge on him. It's not much of a moral shift.
