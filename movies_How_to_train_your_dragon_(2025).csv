"Everything I've seen of this just makes it look completely pointless. 

It's the same movie, but now in live action, and weaker. And on top of that, it uses so much CGI that it completely ruins the point of it being in live action. The only ""live action"" things in most frames is just the actors. I've seen so many clips from the movie that's been shared over the past couple of weeks, all scenes that are just shot-for-shot remakes. They lack the heart and character of the original. 

I don't get it. I mean, I do, it's money and this thing will print it, but it's frustrating. So much resources and talent was wasted on just doing the same thing again and it took years of everyone's time, and millions of dollars. All of that could've gone towards making something new. But no, we get How to Train Your Dragon, again.",Everything Ive seen just makes look completely pointless same movie now live action weaker top uses so much CGI completely ruins point live action only live action things most frames just actors Ive seen so many clips movie thats shared past couple weeks scenes just shotforshot remakes lack heart character original dont get mean money thing will print frustrating So much resources talent wasted just same thing took years everyones time millions dollars couldve gone towards making something new no get Train Dragon,Positive

"I saw the movie a few days ago. Didn't originally intend to, but I had a free ticket. I think a big achievement that's gonna fly under the radar is how it DOESN'T look like a giant CGI fest, and how most of the backgrounds manage to appear natural. Which is really the bare minimum, but that's good. 

Also, getting John Powell to come back was the smartest choice you could have made.

Despite the fact that Im not really an advocate for the live action remakes, HTTYD in my opinion is probably one of the better live action/CGI movies I've seen, it feels a lot more faithful to the original movie as apposed to Lilo and Stitch, and while the CGI and the casting of the characters has some aspects to be desired, I overall liked the movie and the score, especially the score was brilliant.

"The original is my favorite movie of all time. Love the hell out of it. When I'm down in the dumps, that's the movie I watch.

I didn't hate this one. I thought it was pretty alright. You can tell that Mason Thames genuinely loved the original, and it showed in his Hiccup. Throw in Gerald Buttler returning as Stoic, and you already have a good foundation. 

The characters felt...near the original counterparts, with a few changes, of course. Astrid unfortunately felt the weakest, in my opinion. She just seemed so bored with everything around her. The flight on Toothless reminded me of that dinner scene with Emma Watson in Beauty and the Beast. 

Movie looked great. Characters were passible. Runtime definitely felt that extra 20 minutes. Don't feel the need to watch it again, I'll keep to the original. But, I didnt feel like I wasted my time here, and I did have fun. Surprising 7/10 for me.

Do have the mention that the family behind our seats sounded like they were dying of the black plague, so that did damper my experience a little. Thankfully, there were other open seats, so we could move to get away from getting sprayed down with phlegm and open mouth coughing.

"So I have actually seen it, and while I do believe in general, live action movies have been lackluster, I also believe they can have value, as something similar to variations on a theme.

In this case while the story is largely untouched, there are a few expanded scenes, action and flight scenes are considerably longer and a few character motivations are slightly modified.

It's not perfect by any means and in no way a replacement but I could easily swap between watching any of the two versions of this story. I like the way scenes have more room to breathe and it feels like a wider look into the world, while the animated one is more agile and focused especially on Hiccup and Toothless.

So all in all, I'm just glad it exists, the space live action adaptations should be in is that of a remix not a remake.",So actually seen believe general live action movies lackluster also believe can value something similar variations theme case story largely untouched few expanded scenes action flight scenes considerably longer few character motivations slightly modified not perfect means no way replacement could easily swap watching two versions story like way scenes more room breathe feels like wider look world animated one more agile focused especially Hiccup Toothless So Im just glad exists space live action adaptations should remix not remake,Positive

"It's a shame that in remaking this movie they didn't stick closer to the plot of the original books.

In the books Hiccup's hunting dragon Toothless is not a special rare/feared Night Fury but instead a very boring Common or Garden dragon (>!although much later in the book series we learn he is actually something rather special!<).

I suppose the problem is that the books can afford to slowly build out the story whereas the movie needs to deliver spectacle immediately. In the books it doesn't matter that Toothless is mocked by the other vikings but is special to Hiccup, whereas in the movie he has to be shown to be special for the audience to see him as such.

Each book stands alone but also subtly lays down a piece of the groundwork in such a way that the reader's attention isn't drawn to it until everything gets pulled together in the final few books of the series. In each book Hiccup learns an important lesson and/or gains (what turns out to be) a critically important artefact. It's very cleverly written and I have huge respect for Cressida Cowell who must have carefully plotted out the whole 12 book storyline long before sitting down to write the first one.

10/10 recommendation for the books. Better than the movies in every way. Buy a set and read them to the 6+ year old kids in your life -- you'll be hooked.",shame remaking movie didnt stick closer plot original books books Hiccups hunting dragon Toothless not special rarefeared Night Fury instead very boring Common Garden dragon although much later book series learn actually something rather special suppose problem books can afford slowly build story whereas movie needs deliver spectacle immediately books doesnt matter Toothless mocked other vikings special Hiccup whereas movie shown special audience see such Each book stands alone also subtly lays piece groundwork such way readers attention isnt drawn everything gets pulled together final few books series each book Hiccup learns important lesson andor gains turns critically important artefact very cleverly written huge respect Cressida Cowell must carefully plotted whole book storyline long sitting write first one recommendation books Better than movies every way Buy set read year old kids life youll hooked,Positive

"I just saw the movie with my GF, and it made me remember how I felt when i saw the animated version years ago. It was pure nostalgia on my part. But my GF never saw the animated version, and let me tell you that 
, she casually lets out the phrase ""so beautiful"" so many times while watching. She tries to stop herself from crying when toothless was battling the fire dragon. And she laughs at scenes where toothless acts like a dog and a cat. She is impressed when Hiccup takes advantage of what he learns from toothless about dragons. Needless to say, she enjoyed it enough to be excited for the 2nd movie to be released.

If you compared it to the animated version, it doesnt give new stuff, just some setup scenes here and there for the next movie, (if it ever comes out, hopefully it will) . But when watched for the first time, its a memorable ride to experience.

"I've never read the books but I heard they were vastly different from the original HTTYD films. A while ago when they first started filming, or were about to, I saw an article saying that the director wanted to make this live action film closer to the book, and I was actually excited to hear that! Rather than remaking the exact same film but without the great animation and pacing, we would be getting essentially a brand new story that can stand on it's own!

Then I saw the first trailer....

It looked exactly the same as the original animated film. And now it's confirmed it's essentially a pointless copy.

A good remake, regardless of medium, is usually great because of its changes. The Lord of the Rings films make big changes, but they're good ones that make them better movies. Same for Dune 1 and 2.

If you don't make any changes, then you made a cheap copy product, not a piece of art.

Even if the changes were offensive and missed the point, at least Lilo and Stitch TRIED something different and gave people something to talk about and appreciate the original even more because of how bad it was.

Unfortunately though this will make a ton of money because of nostalgia and there are also sadly a lot of people out there that don't like animation purely because it's animated so they'll think this remake is superior",Ive never read books heard vastly different original HTTYD films ago first started filming saw article saying director wanted make live action film closer book actually excited hear Rather than remaking exact same film without great animation pacing would getting essentially brand new story can stand own saw first trailer looked exactly same original animated film now confirmed essentially pointless copy good remake regardless medium usually great changes Lord Rings films make big changes theyre good ones make better movies Same Dune dont make changes made cheap copy product not piece art Even changes offensive missed point least Lilo Stitch TRIED something different gave people something talk appreciate original even more bad Unfortunately though will make ton money nostalgia also sadly lot people dont like animation purely animated so theyll think remake superior,Positive
"I loved it. I typically don’t really bother with live action since the past experiences I had were quite meh. But this one managed to make me feel the same as I did in the animated movie years ago. And I think that’s the most important part. Hiccup was great, I like Astrid in it. It’s not necessary sure, but I’m so glad it didn’t turn out to be a slop. I loved how it’s faithful to the original, and the music was PEAKKK. What I didn’t like so much was the twin’s casting, but I can see that they’re going for a different route with the jokes. Instead of “We look nothing alike” despite looking exactly the same, they went for “We look EXACTLY the same” despite looking completely different. I’m not so sure about Gobber tho, he seems more serious in this one. Toothless is AMAZINGG. Stoic was awesome. I also loved the original scene where Astrid bashes Red Death’s teeth to help her dragon, I liked that one better than in the original animation movie.",loved typically dont really bother live action since past experiences quite meh one managed make feel same animated movie years ago think thats most important part Hiccup great like Astrid not necessary sure Im so glad didnt turn slop loved faithful original music PEAKKK didnt like so much twins casting can see theyre going different route jokes Instead look nothing alike despite looking exactly same went look EXACTLY same despite looking completely different Im not so sure Gobber tho seems more serious one Toothless AMAZINGG Stoic awesome also loved original scene Astrid bashes Red Deaths teeth help dragon liked one better than original animation movie,Positive

I'm fine with these movies being made though.  People obviously want to go watch them otherwise they wouldn't make a profit and wouldn't continue to happen.

"I'm a massive fan of the HTTYD franchise. I was cautiously optimistic for this film because Dean directed it, and since I loved even the controversial third film in the original trilogy, I had faith in him. The fact he openly admitted that he generally hates live action remake but agreed to direct because he wanted to do it justice rather than having some blow in take over, I have massive respect.

I saw it today with my fiancé and we both really enjoyed it. It's nowhere near as good as the original, but Dean still managed to capture the spirit of HTTYD. Let me tell you this, ""The Lion King"" is my favourite film. The 2019 remake is my least favourite film. The original HTTYD is my second favourite film. I was burned before, no pun intended.

"Remake checked the boxes but was not better than any of the animated. 

I was disappointed in Mason and Nico’s chemistry, there had to be a better pair to play them. Mason was alright most of the time, but Nico’s dialogue and expression were so blocky and felt so forced. All of there interactions just were not very believable at all. Made me cringe every time they were together. 

All of the background characters plus Gerard Butler have the Scottish accents but none of the main characters? Dialogue was already bad enough but they sound like a bunch of Americans. We could’ve at least tried to get that part right. 

Environments and CGI were as good as they could be. Obviously Dragons had to be cgi and were made well, all of the environments fit really well too. Tootheless could’ve been a little more variated from the animated version. All of the other dragons got a very realistic remake that looked good in my opinion, but toothless was the exact same. 

There were some iconic moments and lines that were changed just enough for a fan of the originals to notice, but there were also some good changes which added a little more comedic relief than the animated. 

8/10, hope for better in the sequel remake. 

Also if you’ve seen it and you’re a real nerd, you’ll notice John Powell took a somewhat iconic score (in my opinion at least) from the second movie and applied it to the first, probably happened more than once but I noticed it one time in the big fight and it fit perfectly.",Remake checked boxes not better than animated disappointed Mason Nicos chemistry better pair play Mason alright most time Nicos dialogue expression so blocky felt so forced interactions just not very believable Made cringe every time together background characters plus Gerard Butler Scottish accents none main characters Dialogue already bad enough sound like bunch Americans couldve least tried get part right Environments CGI good could Obviously Dragons cgi made well environments fit really well too Tootheless couldve little more variated animated version other dragons got very realistic remake looked good opinion toothless exact same some iconic moments lines changed just enough fan originals notice also some good changes added little more comedic relief than animated hope better sequel remake Also youve seen youre real nerd youll notice John Powell took somewhat iconic score opinion least second movie applied first probably happened more than noticed one time big fight fit perfectly,Positive

"Just came out of the movie, here's my 2c out of the hat.

What struck me the most coming out of the movie were all the little details that show how much Dean DeBlois cares about his work. You can really feel that this live action isn’t just a plain adaptation, but rather a piece that fits thoughtfully into the rest of the saga. There’s genuine respect for the original universe, without falling into lazy copycat. 

What I found especially refreshing was the absence the fan service moment. Sure, there are a few nods and jokes of the original one, but they still avoided to recreate the iconic and fun scene (like the explosion behind Astrid, or Hiccup fainting after freeing Toothless), which is a good thing. It gives the film space to build its own references, to lay its own foundation. 

Some other comments 

I think the whole build-up around Toothless’s mechanical tail, and Hiccup’s work to adapt it, was really well done. 

I liked the space above the hall, gave a cozy vibe. :) 

I really liked how the village elder was given more presence. From the Viking fate reading with the bones to the look on her face when they take Toothless away, as you can tell that deep down, she too might believe there’s another way. 

I actually really liked Astrid in this version, I know the animated film was aimed at kids, but I always found her unbearable in it. Here, she’s way more nuanced, more interesting. She finally gets to be a believable character, not just the standard badass love interest.

Even Snoutlout surprised me. He doesn’t necessarily talk more, but there are these really short shots that say everything about his relationship with his father. And these tiny moments are enough to give him a new kind of depth I’d never noticed before. Well done. 

I honestly have a lot of hope for the third film now. (I know the second gonna be awesome) because I feel like DeBlois is going to keep shining a light on aspects that were a bit overlooked before. For the third movie, I really hope they move away from the overdone romance between Toothless and Toothpaste and explore something with a new angle.

Anywayyyyy, need to process a bit but I think this sub is lacking a bit of positive feedback from people who actually watched the movie! 🐲",Just came movie heres c hat struck most coming movie little details show much Dean DeBlois cares work can really feel live action isnt just plain adaptation rather piece fits thoughtfully rest saga Theres genuine respect original universe without falling lazy copycat found especially refreshing absence fan service moment Sure few nods jokes original one still avoided recreate iconic fun scene like explosion behind Astrid Hiccup fainting freeing Toothless good thing gives film space build own references lay own foundation Some other comments think whole buildup around Toothlesss mechanical tail Hiccups work adapt really well done liked space hall gave cozy vibe really liked village elder given more presence Viking fate reading bones look face take Toothless away can tell deep too might believe theres another way actually really liked Astrid version know animated film aimed kids always found unbearable shes way more nuanced more interesting finally gets believable character not just standard badass love interest Even Snoutlout surprised doesnt necessarily talk more really short shots say everything relationship father tiny moments enough give new kind depth Id never noticed Well done honestly lot hope third film now know second gonna awesome feel like DeBlois going keep shining light aspects bit overlooked third movie really hope move away overdone romance Toothless Toothpaste explore something new angle Anywayyyyy need process bit think sub lacking bit positive feedback people actually watched movie,Positive
"Another point about the dragon that I forgot to say.

For me, the biggest achievement of the film was getting me to believe in the look of a “real” Toothless. Since the first trailer to the very first seconds in the film, something about his face felt off. Honestly, I would have maybe tweaked a few things, maybe to make it closer to the animated version (especially in the details around the head). But as the film went on, it bothered me less and less, and by the end, it hardly stood out at all.

I guess it’s something they must have thought through for a long time. Maybe if they’d made him too close to the animated version, he would’ve looked too friendly? Or just out of place. After all, these are still supposed to be dragons that scare humans in theysotry, not oversized pets! 

That being said, I’m glad the Toothless from the Universal Studios park kept a design that leans more toward the animated version than the live-action one. It shows that there was some real effort behind the visual direction and that the design choices were deliberate, depending on the context.

Tldr: yes they went for dragons that are uncanny rather than cute, and honestly, that’s a good thing. They’re dragons, they’re supposed to be a little scary",Another point dragon forgot say biggest achievement film getting believe look real Toothless Since first trailer very first seconds film something face felt Honestly would maybe tweaked few things maybe make closer animated version especially details around head film went bothered less less end hardly stood guess something must thought long time Maybe theyd made too close animated version wouldve looked too friendly just place still supposed dragons scare humans theysotry not oversized pets said Im glad Toothless Universal Studios park kept design leans more toward animated version than liveaction one shows some real effort behind visual direction design choices deliberate depending context Tldr yes went dragons uncanny rather than cute honestly thats good thing Theyre dragons theyre supposed little scary,Positive

"It was a solid 6/10. It’s enjoyable but nothing out of ordinary. Few scenes were unnecessary.

You could tell that lots of love and money was put into this. Its not complete CGI slop like the disney remakes.  Lots of the sets were physical sets with tons of artistry and detail. It was giving Wicked. The props were great, the costumes and armor (of the adult Vikings atleast) were detailed and beautiful.

"Just watched the movie and as an avid httyd fan and httyd ao3 reader. I loved it. Yes, it’s nearly a shot for shot remake, but that’s all I wanted for this. I can appreciate the small changes they made and they weren’t such horrible big changes that ruined the movie for me. They made sense. For example (spoiler I guess), during Hiccup and Toothless’ first flight at the end they got chard by Toothless’ fire blast. They ended up going through the village and running into Astrid briefly. That’s a very endearing part of the cartoon that gives a lot of personality and humor. I can understand why they removed that from the movie because it probably would’ve been very hard to make that scene look even slightly natural since it was all cramped spaces and having hiccup and Toothless getting very close together and making a mess. I’d rather they removed that scene than try to keep it in and botch it. Same can be said about the dragonnip one. The results of that “weakness” and the secret scratch weakness are very similar and I actually like how they added the goofiness of the dandelions making the dragons sneeze because it adds more variety. 

You can call me sappy, but I honestly cried at some of my favorite scenes because seeing them in live action helped me to feel the original emotion even more intensely. Not to mention hearing the elevated versions of the original soundtrack literally choked me up. I hold this series near and dear to my heart and I’m in no way disappointed with this movie and I’m glad it came out so I could relive one of my favorite childhood movies. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’m with most people where I’m tired of all these remakes and would looove an actual new creative piece of media, but this live action is truly one of the best I’ve watched. If you have some apprehension of watching it because you’re against the whole live action remake trend, then maybe at least watch some clips and give it a small chance. Or don’t, I can’t control y’all’s choices lol but at least try not bashing it too hard without watching even a little bit of the movie. K that’s all I have to say. I’m going to go down the rabbit hole of httyd ao3 fics again now that this has reawakened my passion for it. Also any other avid fans of httyd gimme fanfic recs please lol. :)

"Seeing this version made me appreciate the original even more. Original came out when I was a kid, and I watched it so much back then that when seeing this new version, I can tell what lines were not in the original despite not having seen the original in 10+ years. I could also tell when the tone of certain lines was off in this new version, which takes me to my main gripe.

A good 90% of the actors seem like they never saw the original. Gerard Butler as Stoic (again) was perfect, but the rest of the cast really struggled with delivery. It seemed like they did one take after reading the script 30 seconds prior and called it good. A lot of the lighthearted and heavier moments just didn’t hit as hard.

It was fine/10. I’ll stick with the original though.",Seeing version made appreciate original even more Original came kid watched so much back seeing new version can tell lines not original despite not seen original years could also tell tone certain lines new version takes main gripe good actors seem like never saw original Gerard Butler Stoic perfect rest cast really struggled delivery seemed like one take reading script seconds prior called good lot lighthearted heavier moments just didnt hit hard fine Ill stick original though,Positive

Unless you are already squeamish with 3d glasses I don't see it being an issue.

It would have been SO COOL if they made all the dragons look scary and not like oversized cats. They could have had the Vikings be real people, too. Cursing, actually getting hurt, and bleeding juuuust a little bit. None of the “Stoic magically having super human strength and pummeling dragons for fun” stuff. The live action completely destroys the way that the Vikings interact with the dragons. I miss the Lord of the Rings era of CGI when it felt so much more real!!

"Saw the movie today. This live-action adaptation is quite faithful to the original in most scenes. There have been some changes here and there, both in terms of character design (mainly Astrid and the dragons) and character motivations (again, mainly Astrid, who at the beginning seems to be more focused on money and economic status than glory from the battlefield). The live-action changed some scenes from the original, cutting out some bits and expanding other parts. This was likely done to compensate for the longer time real actors need to express emotion compared to animation. That, combined with some slightly longer action sequences, explains the additional 27 minutes.

A longer movie means having to rework the original score as well, and keeping John Powell as the composer was definitely the right move. He did a good job tailoring together the movie leitmotifs to fill in the gaps between the sections that were 1:1 with the original movie. I was only disappointed in one scene:>!the Test Drive score, which plays in the scene where Hiccup and Toothless properly fly together for the first time, has a specific structure. At the time when they fly too high and briefly detach from each other and start plummeting, there is an abrupt interruption of the music, which immediately resumes in an orchestral crescendo. While they fall, in the original, the music becomes more tense to underline that both characters are panicking. Then, as Hiccup realises that he has to trust his gut and Toothless, there is the release, and we hear Hiccup's and Toothless' themes combine for the first time. In the live-action, the ""tense"" falling scene needs a bit more time, and the beginning of the fall is scored by silence. No sound, like you see in a war or action movie when an explosion happens very close to the protagonist. For me, it just dispelled all the musical tension and weakened the following release, consequently weakening one of the two key scenes of the original movie.!<

About the dragons, I liked their more ""realistic"" design, especially the Mostrous Nightmare. I think they could have emphasized Toothless' expressions a bit more and ramped up his cuteness factor, since he is still completely animated, but it worked fine nonetheless.

**Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and I can definitely recommend watching the movie if you haven't seen the original in a while. It's not a MUST watch, but I don't feel like I wasted money on it.** This movie obviously can't outdo the original because of the human actors, not because they're incompetent, but simply due to the reduced expressivity of real humans that are acting on dialogue designed for animated characters most of the time. For me, personally, it was really interesting to see everything play out with human characters, particularly the young Vikings.

For those complaining about the lack of novelty, I would argue that this movie does exactly what I expect from a live-action remake: follow the original plot, which made the movie so good, but do it with real people, costumes, and sets as much as possible. Of course, sometimes the lighting mismatch was noticeable, but never too bothersome.

For those who wished that this movie were more faithful to the books: your passion made me want to read the books, but remember that this is a *remake*, not a *reboot*, of the original movie. I get that you wanted a more faithful adaptation of the books, but seeing what happened with Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Tales from Earthsea and Dune (and probably many others that don't come to mind atm), I have kinda lost faith in the possibility of adapting long stories to movie series while preserving the original content. The creators who work in the ""receiving"" media might want to add their personal touch to the narrative or character design, and in the case of HTTYD, the ""loosely adapted"" story is still pretty good. Also, there aren't as many movie directors as devoted as Peter Jackson, who sacrificed years of his life to LOTR to deliver a cohesive and well-made movie adaptation. Maybe it can be done with the TV series format?",Saw movie today liveaction adaptation quite faithful original most scenes some changes terms character design mainly Astrid dragons character motivations mainly Astrid beginning seems more focused money economic status than glory battlefield liveaction changed some scenes original cutting some bits expanding other parts likely done compensate longer time real actors need express emotion compared animation combined some slightly longer action sequences explains additional minutes longer movie means rework original score well keeping John Powell composer definitely right move good job tailoring together movie leitmotifs fill gaps sections original movie only disappointed one scenethe Test Drive score plays scene Hiccup Toothless properly fly together first time specific structure time fly too high briefly detach each other start plummeting abrupt interruption music immediately resumes orchestral crescendo fall original music becomes more tense underline characters panicking Hiccup realises trust gut Toothless release hear Hiccups Toothless themes combine first time liveaction tense falling scene needs bit more time beginning fall scored silence No sound like see war action movie explosion happens very close protagonist just dispelled musical tension weakened following release consequently weakening one two key scenes original movie dragons liked more realistic design especially Mostrous Nightmare think could emphasized Toothless expressions bit more ramped cuteness factor since still completely animated worked fine nonetheless Overall enjoyable experience can definitely recommend watching movie havent seen original not MUST watch dont feel like wasted money movie obviously cant outdo original human actors not theyre incompetent simply due reduced expressivity real humans acting dialogue designed animated characters most time personally really interesting see everything play human characters particularly young Vikings complaining lack novelty would argue movie exactly expect liveaction remake follow original plot made movie so good real people costumes sets much possible course sometimes lighting mismatch noticeable never too bothersome wished movie more faithful books passion made want read books remember remake not reboot original movie get wanted more faithful adaptation books seeing happened Harry Potter Hunger Games Tales Earthsea Dune probably many others dont come mind atm kinda lost faith possibility adapting long stories movie series preserving original content creators work receiving media might want add personal touch narrative character design case HTTYD loosely adapted story still pretty good Also arent many movie directors devoted Peter Jackson sacrificed years life LOTR deliver cohesive wellmade movie adaptation Maybe can done TV series format,Positive

"This is why, from a critical point of view, remaking well liked films is an incredibly risky thing to do.

If you remake a film almost beat for beat you open yourself up to direct comparisons. Unless you nail absolutely every beat from casting, to effects, to tone and pacing most people will just return to the original 'superior' product. At best you just have to hope for something that will survive alongside the original.

If you change up from the original you run the risk of the 'original worked better' comparisons. If the original is already a really well liked story those comparisons are going to be even harder to overcome, so you have to go even harder on the changes incurring more risk at creating a different well liked product.

Ultimately the biggest take away from these films is 'whats the point in remaking something thats already good?' (Well the answer is money, and making money off nostalgia and recognisability). The better course would be to remake lesser films that had good ideas but poor execution. As long as you correctly identify where the original went wrong you can implement changes and additions to enhance the product, without the fear or worry of being overshadowed by the original.",critical point view remaking well liked films incredibly risky thing remake film almost beat beat open direct comparisons Unless nail absolutely every beat casting effects tone pacing most people will just return original superior product best just hope something will survive alongside original change original run risk original worked better comparisons original already really well liked story comparisons going even harder overcome so go even harder changes incurring more risk creating different well liked product Ultimately biggest take away films whats point remaking something thats already good Well answer money making money nostalgia recognisability better course would remake lesser films good ideas poor execution long correctly identify original went wrong can implement changes additions enhance product without fear worry overshadowed original,Positive

I get it when we think a remake is unnecessary. But it's not the ""money"" or ""profit making"" that I personally dislikes. It's how they are not appreciating what makes the OGs well-loved.

HTTYD follows the OG. The filmmakers are onboard. I'm excited to see the movie came alive, and most important is some of us, including me, has new people in our lives whom we want to enjoy the moment with in big screen.

"I’m….okay with this? 

The original’s not going anywhere, and I’m hungry for dragon-content that isn’t a cheap CG TV show. And if this means the second and third movies could be redone better (ESPECIALLY the third one), I’m all for it. 

A live-action reboot might also allow for slightly more maturity that wasn’t in the originals.
I admit it, I was an extremely guilty fan of HTTYD fanfics that made things a little more PG and complex.
Like, I wished we could see more dragons and vikings killing and dying on-screen (even without the blood and gore), or characters grasping with more heavy situations. It wouldn’t necessarily make the stories better, but after a whole decade of seeing G-rated HTTYD content, I’d love to see them cut a bit loose for older fans of the series.

I’d also love it if they flesh out the characters that aren’t Hiccup and Astrid, especially the other kid characters. They’re fine in the first movie, but in the sequels? Much of the time, they were nothing but one-note comic relief characters, and by the third movie they got pretty exhausting (especially when they weren’t all that funny). 

And John Powell. They better get that glorious goddamn man back as composer. The guy made my favourite movie soundtrack of all time, and he’s a third of the reason why the first movie was so f***ing amazing. I’m STILL bitter his work didn’t earn him an Oscar that year (sorry, Trent Reznor’s ‘The Social Network’ soundtrack).

While excellent films in their own right, they were not true adaptations — Toothless was not Hiccup’s riding dragon, but a small dragon he had on his shoulder. Fishlegs was his skinny best friend (hence the name Fishlegs) and Snotlout was his cousin who kept trying to kill him.

The book series started off light-hearted enough, before proceeding to explore heavier themes — from slavery and its consequences to a multitude of character deaths and a world-encompassing war. The third book involved Hiccup taking on waterbound dragons from (barely) a boat in a Roman colosseum. Another has him slowly being poisoned while sneaking past an army to find the cure. Another has him in a swordfight with his nemesis in the centre of an erupting volcano. Another has him avoiding a dragon in a library, in the style of *Jurassic Park*’s *velociraptors*. I would highly recommend it to read. Hiccup could also speak the dragons’ language — not mystically, but because he actually went out of his way to learn it as one would learn any other language.",uGroundAirMissile upwnd Oh should readaptation original book series completely different plot than animated film series excellent films own right not true adaptations Toothless not Hiccups riding dragon small dragon shoulder Fishlegs skinny best friend hence name Fishlegs Snotlout cousin kept trying kill book series started lighthearted enough proceeding explore heavier themes slavery consequences multitude character deaths worldencompassing war third book involved Hiccup taking waterbound dragons barely boat Roman colosseum Another slowly poisoned sneaking past army find cure Another swordfight nemesis centre erupting volcano Another avoiding dragon library style Jurassic Parks velociraptors would highly recommend read Hiccup could also speak dragons language not mystically actually went way learn one would learn other language,Positive

"I'm going to sound condescending here, and I don't mean to. Because I'm not trying to make you feel dumb. But you're missing my point. 

Stoic is, literally, larger than life. No real person has his dimensions, unless you try to squeeze an 800-pound bariatric patient into a storage freezer. And yet Stoic expects his son the twig boy to live up to him, both literally and figuratively, as chief. 

The cartoonish visual design is underscoring the theme of adolescent expectation Hiccup is dealing with. He knows he can't be like his dad, in every single sense. And he doesn't want to be, despite desperately craving his approval. The only way he can reconcile this is by finding his own way, that both stays true to his own less aggressive and more inquisitive personality while also being helpful to his clan. 

The fact that the adult vikings are all Scottish muscle-bound Swarzenegger cutouts and the kids are all mostly ordinary American-accented humans is a visualization of the disconnect between the adults and the adolescents. It's taking advantage of animation as a medium. It's something that isn't possible to replicate in live action, because as soon as you have a cast of more than five people the physical differences will start to blur, especially with everyone wearing the same leather armor. 

See also: Toothless. Most of the dragons we see before him are shrouded in darkness, covered in fire, or chomping down with rows and rows of teeth. They're scary, at least for kids. Toothless has the proportions of a corgi, gigantic eyes like a kitten, and the expressive voice of a husky. He's a pet, someone we instantly want to cuddle. Replace him with, say, one of the dragons from Game of Thrones, who fit into their live action world in the same way, and you've got kids screaming in the theater. 

But if you plop Toothless into Game of Thrones, he looks like what he is: a cartoon interacting with real people. Both the tone and the medium clash, and masterful design work is thrown away because DreamWorks wants to repeat Disney's mistakes...albeit some very profitable ones.",Im going sound condescending dont mean Im not trying make feel dumb youre missing point Stoic literally larger than life No real person dimensions unless try squeeze pound bariatric patient storage freezer yet Stoic expects son twig boy live literally figuratively chief cartoonish visual design underscoring theme adolescent expectation Hiccup dealing knows cant like dad every single sense doesnt want despite desperately craving approval only way can reconcile finding own way stays true own less aggressive more inquisitive personality also helpful clan fact adult vikings Scottish musclebound Swarzenegger cutouts kids mostly ordinary Americanaccented humans visualization disconnect adults adolescents taking advantage animation medium something isnt possible replicate live action soon cast more than five people physical differences will start blur especially everyone wearing same leather armor See also Toothless Most dragons see shrouded darkness covered fire chomping rows rows teeth Theyre scary least kids Toothless proportions corgi gigantic eyes like kitten expressive voice husky Hes pet someone instantly want cuddle Replace say one dragons Game Thrones fit live action world same way youve got kids screaming theater plop Toothless Game Thrones looks like cartoon interacting real people tone medium clash masterful design work thrown away DreamWorks wants repeat Disneys mistakesalbeit some very profitable ones,Positive

Hi everyone, 

We're the VFX team from How To Train Your Dragon (2025):


Christian Manz - Production VFX Supervisor (Other credits: Fantastic Beasts, Harry Potter, 47 Ronin, Primeval, Dracula Untold) IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1114640/

Tom Wilton - Creature Puppetry Supervisor (Other credits: Jurassic World: Dominion, Jurassic World: Rebirth, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Fantastic Beasts, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, Snow White, Rogue: A Star Wars Story, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2478092/ 

Glen McIntosh - Production Animation Supervisor (Other credits: Avatar: The Way of the Water, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Transformers, The Day After Tomorrow, The Mummy, Lone Survivor, Eragon) - IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1031244/



This film required a real partnership between special effects and visual effects to make Berk and its inhabitants feel as real as possible. Each dragon was built from the skeleton outwards, ensuring that their muscle structure, skin texture, and proportions worked together. Stitches and Glue then built incredible puppets to the scale we'd established, so that the actors had something real to work with.

Also if I can ask a follow up, how hard was working on the effects for the Red Death? Her effects seem challenging given everything going on.

"Hello!

Considering this is a live-action reimagining of an animated movie, there are some things I want to know from the perspective of the vfx people (and as a filmmaker, I have some ideas for a narrative/documentary film about making a movie itself but from the perspective of vfx people).

1. What movies or any work of art that inspired you all to become vfx artists?

2. People have said that the reason why there live-action remakes of animated works are happening because CGI artists are not unionized and paid less compared to 2D animators. How much that is true? (Another layman explanation that I have heard was ""CGI allowed studios to render images that could only be done in 2D animation in photorealistic way."")

3. How was Dean DeBlois as a director?

4. What's your favorite of the original animated HTTYD series?",Hello Considering liveaction reimagining animated movie some things want know perspective vfx people filmmaker some ideas narrativedocumentary film making movie perspective vfx people movies work art inspired become vfx artists People said reason liveaction remakes animated works happening CGI artists not unionized paid less compared D animators much true Another layman explanation heard CGI allowed studios render images could only done D animation photorealistic way Dean DeBlois director Whats favorite original animated HTTYD series,Positive

"Hello ! I just wanted to say thank you to all the hard work you all put into the film ! And thank you for being so kind to answer questions!

A few questions about toothless, I saw it said earlier about toothless wings being based on bat wings in the live action whereas, you could say more eagle like in the 2010 film, what was the reasoning behind this ? Were there challenges or concerns with this as it changed toothless' silhouette quite a bit from the OG.

I also wanted to say I adore the iridescence shimmer with those blue teal tones you all gave toothless in the live action ! I think it helped give depth to him in scenes and bring out the scale pattern. Toothless seemed to lack his markings like in the OG was there a technical or aesthetic reasoning around this, was the iridescence almost like a replacement?

Sneaky last question...obviously I doubt much can be said about this, but do you think toothless' design will evolve between this and the second film, to represent his growth and the passage of time ? 👀

I am glad you guys all seemed to have so much fun working on this film !

"It was a blessing because it was the opportunity to work with Dean who is the author of the original.  The challenge was finding the moments that are so iconic and making sure we gave the fans what they wanted while still being reverential to the original animated film which we all love so much.  The trickiesst aspect going from animation to live action was making the dragons feel believable next to the humans and giving them the proper weight and timing for animals that are quite huge.  Toothless in the original animated version was around 12 feet long but for our film he was sized up to being 34 feet long!  So a huge animal.

Everything we did involved resdesign, and we needed our Dragons to have a much higher level of detail to match their live action surroundings.

"I agree with Glen in that Test Drive is the thing I'm most proud of.  It's such an iconic scene in the original and a massive challenge to pull of in live action.  We really wanted you to feel the connection between Hiccup and Toothless, as well as making it as immersive as we could.  It was very satisfying to hear the audience cheer and applaud after it at the Premiere.

The Red Death was literally a huge challenge as not only did she require a high level of detail in look and animation, she also interacts with her environment a lot - covering all the difficult stuff from water to fire!

"Just want to jump in on your second question. VFX is unfortunately not unionized, but VFX artists still generally earn more than animators. Animated films typically have much smaller budgets than live action (a byproduct of their being ""for kids,"" whether or not that's true) and animation workers generally are paid less than their live action counterparts as a consequence even with a union.",Just want jump second question VFX unfortunately not unionized VFX artists still generally earn more than animators Animated films typically much smaller budgets than live action byproduct kids whether not thats true animation workers generally paid less than live action counterparts consequence even union,Positive

"Hi there, all of our decisions were driven by looking at real animals in the natural world.  We looked at bats for Toothless' wings as they were the most similar anatomy wise.  For any creature work I have been part of, mother nature has been a key reference because that's what the audience recognises and makes them relate to the character - part of the reason everyone loves Toothless is because his behaviour is based on domestic cats and dogs, amongst other animal.

"Thanks for the question!  Test Drive was the most challenging AND rewarding.  Mostly because we wanted to preserve what was so beautiful about the original animated film but also create a flying experience for the big screen that feels photographic.  Meaning something that you could achieve with motion picture cameras.  Sometimes that meant building little imperfections into the camera work just as a camera person (in a helicopter) would have trouble framing a real animal flying at 200mph!

"Thanks for the question!  For me, form follows function.  So I was incredibly thankful to be involved so early in the process!  Meaning that we wanted Toothless to have panther-like movements but be able to soar in the air and be as regal as a golden eagle.  So it meant looking at the proportions of those animals and making adjustments to our animated model so that the animators could achieve those actions.  Nothing in nature is designed by accident so we were very mindful about finding that sweet spot between a beautiful design and how that design would have evolved if it was a real animal.  - GM",Thanks question form follows function So incredibly thankful involved so early process Meaning wanted Toothless pantherlike movements able soar air regal golden eagle So meant looking proportions animals making adjustments animated model so animators could achieve actions Nothing nature designed accident so very mindful finding sweet spot beautiful design design would evolved real animal GM,Positive
"Creatively, it was Toothless.  He is the star of the film and we knew he had to deliver performance wise and in his live action look.   It's been great that everyone has fallen in love with him again,

Technically I would say either the Red Death because of her huge scale and interaction with her environment, or Monstrous Nightmare because of his armoured plating and the fact that they're on fire in a lot of scenes. 

Cheers, Christian",Creatively Toothless star film knew deliver performance wise live action look great everyone fallen love Technically would say either Red Death huge scale interaction environment Monstrous Nightmare armoured plating fact theyre fire lot scenes Cheers Christian,Positive
"Thanks for the question!  From a design and animation point of view, Toothless was easily the most difficult.  The other dragons could be scary or cute or regal but Toothless had to be all of those qualities.  I always likened him to a Siberian Tiger.  A tiger is an absolutely beautiful animal.  But if that tiger was right next to you and roaring in your face, it would be absolutely terrifying!  That's why Hiccup is so scared and also so brave to approach Toothless.  

When Toothless fights the Monstrous Nightmare to save Hiccup we went out of our way to build those feline like qualities into his fighting.  Although the Nightmare is a bigger dragon, Toothless is like a tiger hell bent on defending its cubs or in this case, Hiccup.

But Toothless also had to be endearing and cute.  So once again it meant looking at the mannerisms of cats and dogs.  We didn't want to over-animate the facial features of Toothless.  That had the potential to be too ""cartoony"" in what we were saying was a real animal.  So the goal was to see if we could get a similar expression of curiosity or fear or contentment out of just head tilts or body postures similar to the way a dog or cat will cock their head as they listen to you.  By virtue of Toothless' design, sometimes to look determined or angry, it simply meant lowering the head.  Just as with animals like eagles and rattlesnakes, the design of the brow defines a determined/angry expression.

Knowing just how much to push those poses and expressions to make them obvious to the audience was something that we worked on for the entire show.  Dean always said that if we could have people watching the movie and nudge their family member or friend during the movie and say ""my cat/dog does that!"", then we have been successful. -GM",Thanks question design animation point view Toothless easily most difficult other dragons could scary cute regal Toothless qualities always likened Siberian Tiger tiger absolutely beautiful animal tiger right next roaring face would absolutely terrifying Thats Hiccup so scared also so brave approach Toothless Toothless fights Monstrous Nightmare save Hiccup went way build feline like qualities fighting Although Nightmare bigger dragon Toothless like tiger hell bent defending cubs case Hiccup Toothless also endearing cute So meant looking mannerisms cats dogs didnt want overanimate facial features Toothless potential too cartoony saying real animal So goal see could get similar expression curiosity fear contentment just head tilts body postures similar way dog cat will cock head listen virtue Toothless design sometimes look determined angry simply meant lowering head Just animals like eagles rattlesnakes design brow defines determinedangry expression Knowing just much push poses expressions make obvious audience something worked entire show Dean always said could people watching movie nudge family member friend movie say catdog successful GM,Positive
"Thanks for the questions from Oliver and Charlie!  We made sure to look at real animals and use their mannerisms and movements to make the dragons FEEL like real animals that everyone sees when they go to the zoo.  Whether it is a panther or a dog waiting for a treat or sneezing or a crocodile hissing, we use those actions to inform the attitude and actions of our dragons so they remind you of a living animal.  At Framestore, the company that created the animation and visual effects, they are experts at looking at the scales and claws and muscles and skin of various reptiles and birds and incorporating them into our finished dragons!  Making them relatable was very important to our Director Dean!

"Thanks for the question!  The textures and sheen on the scales was something we worked on for every shot.  If you add too many bumpy osteoderms, you run the risk of Toothless looking like an old saltwater crocodile.  If you add too much sheen, you run the risk of Toothless looking slimy.  So Toothless had to feel like a snake that had just shed his skin and was shiny but not slimy.  He had to have beautiful scale patterning that made you want to pet him and not recoil in revulsion as some people do when they see large reptiles!  His scales are indeed a bit more roughed up and dry after the fight in the arena and when he is chained and placed aboard Stoic's boat.  We definitely initially experimented with Toothless being more grey on his underside and darker on his top side like the ""counter shading"" you see on SO many animals.  From crocodiles to great white sharks to tigers to iguanas, they typically have a lighter colored belly and a darker top side.  The greyer skin tended to make Toothless feel like an older dragon and we wanted to give the impression that Toothless was a younger dragon akin in age (in dragon years) to Hiccup.  It also felt a little too different from the Toothless everyone fell in love with.  :).   -GM",Thanks question textures sheen scales something worked every shot add too many bumpy osteoderms run risk Toothless looking like old saltwater crocodile add too much sheen run risk Toothless looking slimy So Toothless feel like snake just shed skin shiny not slimy beautiful scale patterning made want pet not recoil revulsion some people see large reptiles scales indeed bit more roughed dry fight arena chained placed aboard Stoics boat definitely initially experimented Toothless more grey underside darker top side like counter shading see SO many animals crocodiles great white sharks tigers iguanas typically lighter colored belly darker top side greyer skin tended make Toothless feel like older dragon wanted give impression Toothless younger dragon akin age dragon years Hiccup also felt little too different Toothless everyone fell love GM,Positive

"Are there any Sith or baddies as a third option?  I had the opportunity to animate General Grievous and work with George Lucas on ROTS so I have a soft spot for the bad, evil characters.  I remember after dailies, I had done a number of sketch poses for Grievous that we could incorporate into his fighting style.  I was able to catch George before he was whisked off to another meeting and I spread my drawings out over a table and George was discussing which poses he thought were worth pursuing and which were not as strong.  I was so busy taking notes that I only later realized I was helping to design a villain for a Star Wars movie with one of my childhood heroes.

"Thanks for the question!  Bringing our dragons into the real world from an animation point of view meant globally slowing them down so that they had the scale of the animals that you would see in a nature documentary.  Meaning that the dragons could be comedic or scary or endearing but as much as possible, just like with the dinosaurs in Jurassic, we leaned into the reference of real life animals.  Whether it was elephants or lions or golden eagles or saltwater crocodiles, we let nature inform a lot of the movement and mannerisms.  Of course there are cinematic conceits such as the Gronkel which was as big as a rhino but had funny little wings that beat very fast.  But as far as the weight of the Gronkel in flight, we made sure that it couldn't stop on a dime with all that weight and momentum.  And then of course, it has the qualities of a French bulldog.

"We worked on his design for a few months before we began work on the film proper - we looked at a lot of real world reference whilst trying to keep the key desing elements such as the eyes, ear plates and heavy bottomed legs.  We ended up with a much bigger Night Fury than in the original film, with a proportionally smaller head and eyes but longer neck and much larger wings.  We refined the design in animation in pre production - locking his size when Mason was cast.  The Framestore London team then started building the final version from the skeleton out - as you get so close to him and he interacts with HIccup a lot, he needed a lot of detail in both look and things like skin and muscle simulation,  All in all it was about 2 years work from the first concept to the first final trailer shot.

"Thanks for the questions!  We definitely had the original as our touchstone.  Dean very much leaned into the idea of if we were going to REALLY shoot a flying dragon and it was going 200mph, how would we do it?  So probably from a helicopter about a 1/4 mile away and using a 100mm lens and because it is a living thing, the framing wouldn't be perfect and the cameraman would be making subtle adjustments.  It also meant throwing a lot of the background detail away to feel more photographic and less synthetic.  As far as the actions themselves, to fit into a real world with actors, it meant slowing the actions down to scale the dragons up.  In the original, Toothless is around 12 feet long but we scaled Toothless up to be 34 feet long!  So an enormous animal!  :).   -GM",Thanks questions definitely original touchstone Dean very much leaned idea going REALLY shoot flying dragon going mph would So probably helicopter mile away using mm lens living thing framing wouldnt perfect cameraman would making subtle adjustments also meant throwing lot background detail away feel more photographic less synthetic far actions fit real world actors meant slowing actions scale dragons original Toothless around feet long scaled Toothless feet long So enormous animal GM,Positive
"Dean's rule was that he didn't want any shots in the film that would pull him out, and that we had to try and best the amazing work the Dreamworks team had done on the original.

As well as giving the dragons more depth, our biggest change was in cinematography working with Bill Pope.  We wanted the flying sequences to feel visceral and immersive so our shooting style was based on what we would have had to have done to shoot it for real - for helicopters, drones, go pros and mounted cameras.  We spent a lot of time, from previs to the very last days of animation trying to make the camera work the best we could.

So, I guess the quick answer would be that the original film was a starting point but not something we slavishly referenced.  We wanted to make our version our own.

"Thanks for the question!  Any time you have complex choreography such as Toothless drawing in the sand,  complex performance such as Hiccup and Toothless meeting each other or sheer volume of animated characters such as all the dragons exiting the volcano, it can be an enormous challenge.  With the choreography, you can have complex interactions between the humans and dragons such as when Toothless and Stoic and all the warrior Vikings are fighting in the main arena while Toothless defends Hiccup from the Monstrous Nightmare.  Tom's puppeteering of Toothless informed the framing and composition as well as timing that all has to work together.  Complex actions and fight sequences were achieved with previsualization to give the camerapeople an idea of what the actions would be once the dragons were inserted into the shots.  Over 200 fully costumed extras were informed of where and when to look and react to the fighting dragons.

The gimbel that Mason rode incorporated the amazing animation that Kayn Garcia and his Framestore team created before principal photography so that Mason inherited the correct movement of the flapping and turning and diving and various actions that Toothless had to do.

Sometimes you are worried about where the stunt performers are positioned in relationship to where Toothless is supposed to be.  Poor Tom was rushed at by all the stunt people for numerous takes!  We had to make sure there was geometry represented so that the stunt vikings weren't moving where Toothless would ultimately be.

"Thanks for the kind words!  The modeling team at Framestore looked at thousands of pictures and videos of real reptiles and mammals.  Toothless was literally built inside out.  Meaning that he has a skeletal structure and over that, they place the muscles and tendons and skin.  Dean always loved evaluating the Toothless flap and walk cycles with just the skeleton.  It just looked so cool!  Then they looked at reference of bats and how their wing membranes (between their fingers) could expand and collapse and fold.

Just like you see on the feet of an ostrich or cassowary, the skin folds bunch up as the ostrich places weight on the planted foot and as it is pulled forward and the toes stretch, that flap disappears.  So to your point, it was about defining the areas where the skin would be thinner/thicker.  So the foot pads could squish as Toothless planted his weight and the muscles could compress when Toothless is seated.  

So nature informed a great deal of the design choices.  Toothless is a creature of fantasy grounded in what we see on animals all around us everyday.  The modelers and enveloping team even had to figure out the double scapulas on Toothless!  Meaning that he had the shoulder of a panther and then ANOTHER shoulder above that defining the wing anatomy since bat wings are just arms with elongated fingers with membranes between them.  The Deadly Nadder and Monstrous Nightmare walked on their wings and those types of dragons are known as wyverns.

"Photoreal assets are expensive to commission because you need 3D Modellers, Riggers and Surfacers spending weeks to months on just one asset. Varies depending on if it’s a hero asset or not.

And that’s just the asset. For every single shot you need to 3D Track, Layout, Animate, Light, Render and Composite. 

A scale that gets thrown around is that it takes one Animator about one week to do 2 seconds of work per asset per shot.

And that’s just for the Dragons. Can’t begin to talk about Environments or FX work.

"Thanks for the question!  Any time you adapt a movie and specifically an animated movie for live action you always walk a VERY fine line of retaining what the audience fell in love with in the first place and presenting fans with a cinematic experience where both fans AND a whole new audience can see the story in a new medium and light.  In that respect, HTTYD is a great candidate to interpret to live action.

We get to make the dragons feel as real as possible and we get real actors interpreting the dialogue but we also have Dean as the original author of the work having a grand general view of the point of the story and the journey those characters take.  

As an animator, I know that every moment, every frame, defines a performance from the humans to the dragons.   The advantage of live action are in all the performance decisions that the actors make that then inform how the dragons react.  Tom Wilton, the head puppeteer of Toothless gave an amazing performance where the actors were not reacting to just a cardboard cutout or a tennis ball but a real creature with foam geometry that represented the actual size of the dragon's heads.  It was amazing how different the actors reacted to those heads!   That's a wordy way of saying the animators relied on those reactions to put extra embellishment into the animation so that they felt like real animals.  That was the attempt and the goal.  

As far as the cinematography and approach to the action sequences, we wanted to lean into the limitations/advantages of principal and location photography.  I mentioned it in an earlier answer (so apologies if you already read that) but if Toothless was REAL and Mason was really on him, how would you film it?  Well it would probably be from a helicopter with a cameraman desperately trying to frame the actions of a real flying animal.

"Thanks for the question!  Because a movie of this complexity has so many sequences involving so many creatures, a lot of the previsualization drives what is filmed on set.  The size of the dragons helps to inform the compositions by cinematographer Bill Pope.  There are lots of embellishments that come from principal photography that then inform the dragon animation in post production but we were very aware of the sequences that required an enormous amount of planning.  Tom Wilton, who was the amazing puppeteer who played Toothless, made acting decisions that gave cues to the actors AND the animators to give us wonderful moments to cue off of in an almost improvisational quality.  -  GM",Thanks question movie complexity so many sequences involving so many creatures lot previsualization drives filmed set size dragons helps inform compositions cinematographer Bill Pope lots embellishments come principal photography inform dragon animation post production very aware sequences required enormous amount planning Tom Wilton amazing puppeteer played Toothless made acting decisions gave cues actors animators give us wonderful moments cue almost improvisational quality GM,Positive
"Thanks for the question!  As you said, it IS a lot more complicated. When you look at the Toothless design and put it next to our ""realistic"" Toothless, there are a great number of changes.  For one, the scale is much different.  In the animated film, Toothless is about the equivalent of 12 feet long and for our movie, Toothless is scaled up to 34 feet!  So an enormous animal!  But more specifically, the limbs and body for our Toothless more closely matched that of a panther.  Sleek and muscular and less salamander than the Toothless in the original film but more cat-like.  In addition, just like the beautifully patterned scales and osteoderms on the Stan Winston animatronic dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, every square inch of Toothless was taken into consideration and given complex patterning that you would see on a monitor lizard or saltwater crocodile.  The one thing that we needed to retain was the large eyes.  So they are smaller than the animated version but we didn't want to embellish the design so much that we lost what everyone fell in love with when they see our Toothless.  Meaning that we could be scary and more nature-inspired with our other dragons but Toothless couldn't be a dragon like Vermithrax in Dragonslayer or Game of Thrones.  We have the Deadly Nadder, Monstrous Nightmare, Hideous Zippleback and Red Death for that!   

BUT the fact that for many people, it was immediately recognizable AS Toothless was quite honestly a big win in our minds.  The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless and their endearing friendship is the key to the whole story.  To them it FELT like the Toothless they remember. The last thing we wanted was Toothless to make his big debut in the trailer and everyone looked at the screen and went, ""WHAT IS THAT???  THAT'S NOT TOOTHLESS!""   :).  -GM",Thanks question said lot more complicated look Toothless design put next realistic Toothless great number changes one scale much different animated film Toothless equivalent feet long movie Toothless scaled feet So enormous animal more specifically limbs body Toothless more closely matched panther Sleek muscular less salamander than Toothless original film more catlike addition just like beautifully patterned scales osteoderms Stan Winston animatronic dinosaurs Jurassic Park every square inch Toothless taken consideration given complex patterning would see monitor lizard saltwater crocodile one thing needed retain large eyes So smaller than animated version didnt want embellish design so much lost everyone fell love see Toothless Meaning could scary more natureinspired other dragons Toothless couldnt dragon like Vermithrax Dragonslayer Game Thrones Deadly Nadder Monstrous Nightmare Hideous Zippleback Red Death fact many people immediately recognizable Toothless quite honestly big win minds relationship Hiccup Toothless endearing friendship key whole story FELT like Toothless remember last thing wanted Toothless make big debut trailer everyone looked screen went THATS NOT TOOTHLESS GM,Positive
"As much as possible, we wanted HTTYD to have a distinct visual language.  That visual language extended to every aspect of the art direction.  Meaning that from the giant horned helmets to the stylized village of Berk to the colorful costumes, the movie could not be mistaken for something like Conan the Barbarian, Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones.  Our Vikings do not have historically accurate nasal helms and coats of chain mail but their art and architecture and weapons are inspired by the fantastical dragons they have fought.  Just look at Stoic's wrist gauntlets adorned with dragon claws.

That visual language also extended to the dragons themselves.  So while we took inspiration from real animals as far as the scale and muscular detail, we wanted to retain qualities that made you recognize that these are the same dragons as the dragons from the animated film.  Grounded in a natural evolution (like dinosaurs) but not so stylized that they looked incongruent standing next to our real actors.   We DID preserve a lot of the color and striking silhouettes.  Instead of drab olive and khaki colored dragons, our dragons retained the vibrant blues, reds, oranges, greens and blacks of the animated feature dragons but embellished with patterning that took inspiration from living reptiles and even birds like the living dinosaur, the cassowary.  We had both traditional dragons and wyverns (they are like bats) where the arms ARE the wings with membrane stretched between the fingers.  The dragons in Game of Thrones are ONLY wyverns but are beautifully rendered and detailed.  As with the tradition of the dragons in all the HTTYD movies, Dean has always wanted to explore the endless variety of dragons that are not JUST winged serpents with head horns.  I like to think that if you lined up all the amazing dragons from cinema  (Vermithrax Pejorative in Dragonslayer, the Dragon from the 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Smaug and the Fell Beasts from The Hobbit and LOTR,  the many wyverns in Game of Thrones, the Krayt Dragon from the Mandolorian), you would be able to pick out the HTTYD dragons quite easily and they would still be just as iconic.............but then after designing and working on the dragons for almost three years I am a tad biased.   :).

"Ive already typed some thoughts on this in an earlier comment but I just had some more thoughts:

\- The big addition I noticed was the town hall meeting where they argue the reasons on going on their first dragon attack. It was curious to see this get fleshed out and see how the make up of the clan is made up by a lot of other vikings from around the world? Seems like a good way to be more inclusive and show Stoick at his most stubborn. The theme of generational war is very current.

\- Peter Serafinowicz made me laugh everytime he blanked his son.

\-  I had trouble with Ruffnut & Tuffnut, took me a long time to accept the actors in their roles but Nico Parker was really solid and Ricky Baker is getting paid. Its hard to translate those relationships in the animated film to live action, chemistry is bloody hard to capture.

\- I hope Gerald Butler drank a lot of honey and ginger tea, his voice must be shot after each scene, still he was the MVP in this, he broke me when he started the emotional 'son' scenes and that line saying hes proud that he's his son....I had tears in my eyes. Im sure its harder than it looks from just doing the voice to actually bringing Stoic to life in live action, his wardrobe looked heavy, haha.

\- The Hiccup scene at the end and seeing his 'foot' for the first time hits differently in live action, I was not prepared for that.

\- John Powell's score is still godamman good. Test Drive, Forbidden Friendship elevates those scenes so much.

\- Be curious to see if no.2 (and 3?) will have more substantial changes than this adaption.

\- Cate Blanchett is a must!!!!",Ive already typed some thoughts earlier comment just some more thoughts big addition noticed town hall meeting argue reasons going first dragon attack curious see get fleshed see make clan made lot other vikings around world Seems like good way more inclusive show Stoick most stubborn theme generational war very current Peter Serafinowicz made laugh everytime blanked son trouble Ruffnut Tuffnut took long time accept actors roles Nico Parker really solid Ricky Baker getting paid hard translate relationships animated film live action chemistry bloody hard capture hope Gerald Butler drank lot honey ginger tea voice must shot each scene still MVP broke started emotional son scenes line saying hes proud hes sonI tears eyes Im sure harder than looks just voice actually bringing Stoic life live action wardrobe looked heavy haha Hiccup scene end seeing foot first time hits differently live action not prepared John Powells score still godamman good Test Drive Forbidden Friendship elevates scenes so much curious see no will more substantial changes than adaption Cate Blanchett must,Positive

"I'm a massive fan of HTTYD. The original is my second favourite film after ""The Lion King"" (1994). I was cautiously optimistic for this remake because Dean DeBlois was directing. He actually hates the live action trend, and agreed to direct the film so some random blow in wouldn't fuck up his and Chris' vision. I wasn't expecting a 2019 ""The Lion King"" scenario where it completely sucked out the soul and made me want to die. 

I'm pleased to say I really enjoyed the movie. Is it perfect? No. Is it as good as the original film or its sequels? Absolutely not. However, it's evident that Dean adores the world and the characters. A few notes:

* I was terrified they'd fuck up ""Forbidden Friendship,"" my favourite scene in film. It's not as good but it still had the sauce and made me happy.

* That fish looked fucking nasty my fiancé and I gagged.

* So how the hell are they gonna address the fact that Valka canonically has not got tig ol' biddies when her breastplate was somehow massive. Dean you could have fixed this.

* No reference to Grimmel when Stoick said ""nobody has killed a Night Fury."" Or THW. Weird since they referenced the second film.

* While I do miss the original line up of the crescendo of the score hitting with Toothless bracing the air right before he and Hiccup zip through the canyons by instinct and trust, it makes up for it by lining up with Hiccup snapping his foot in the stirrup instead. The timing is there it's just in a different part of the scene. The scene gave me goosebumps, as Thor intended.

* I love the addition of dragons seen later in the franchise, such as the Skrill and Rumblehorn.

* The Red Death is fucking horrifying looking. 

* Oh thank God Toothless doesn't look like booty cheeks. I love all Toothli equally, even the one in the TV show that looks like he was stung by a bee. I was so scared LA Toothless would look awful but he didn't. His design is definitely a bit different: his wings are completely changed, he has his beard nubs from the second film and most notably he has digitrade legs. Digitrade legs are what animals like dogs and cats have. Plantigrade is like what humans and lizards have. He's digitrade to harken back to his panther inspiration, but more than likely also because avians are digitrade. Not only does he look good but his sound bank has been expanded and he is just so baby I love him.

* There are a few things changed I liked and others I didn't. I did like Astrid going directly into the Red Death's mouth. I really like Hiccup knowing what happened to Valka, hell I love that Valka was mentioned. I really liked them giving more to Spitelout and Snotlout. I didn't like the music change for ""Downed Dragon,"" and how Toothless didn't pin Hiccup to the rock as aggressively as in the original. It was weird because they actually captured his feral nature well otherwise. I also miss the moment during ""Forbidden Friendship"" where he notices the dagger and urges Hiccup to throw it away. Astrid was much more of a hard ass, which is something I'm mixed on. I do like how she apologized to Toothless, yet on the flip side I don't like how Toothless didn't show Stoick that Hiccup was ok after *he* apologised. I fucking loved the use of the theme from the second film where Drago's Bewilderbeast forces Toothless to kill Stoick. It adds an interesting element, but also may confuse the plot of the second and third films: if the Red Death is an alpha, does that mean Toothless is now? Does this change how alphas work in general? Also I needed more of Toothless going absolutely mental in the house at the end. Him crying to Hiccup on the boat when trapped oh MY HEART.

* while the animation was great, it does seem the flying animation isn't quite as polished as the original trilogy. For example, when Toothless is trying to escape the cove, he doesn't have the same grace. Yes he's frantic and scared, plus he's injured and when he falls you can tell it hurts, but even a paper plane when thrown with a bent nose will land with some grace. This was captured in the original. There's also a missed opportunity to show off his immense wingspan during ""New Tail."" His flying otherwise looks great, but isn't captured as well due to shaky cam. When the camera actually stabilizes it looks great. I'm unsure how Dean will handle the aerial dog fight camera angles of the battle in the second film. 

* Gerard Butler somehow acting more animated than he did in the original, and it's so much fun.

* Hiccup has his chin scar!

* NO JØNSI HOW DARE 

* Did I mention that Toothless is baby?

* An interesting choice in cutting the Terrible Terror scene where you learn that dragons are not fireproof on the inside in a very funny way. Now it is shown earlier with the Zippleback, in that the gas left from the maw is lit by a spark, but the scene with the TT really makes you go ""ooooh,"" which makes the moment where Hiccup lights up the Red Death's gas even cooler.

* I always interpreted the Red Death spreading her wings after being ignited as a sign of her going ""oh shit oh fuck emergency landing,"" then we see her wings being ripped apart by Toothless' plasma blasts. This happens here too, but her panic is clearly shown and I felt so validated.

* All the dragons look great.

* ""We've killed thousands of them!"".... ""They took your MOTHER!"" 

* Toothless is still super expressive. He still has his sass too! His smile unfortunately doesn't translate well into live action but it's ok I still love him.

* John Powell score my funeral.

Overall the main issues were the pacing not being as great (it's still good but not as good), the acting being held back a bit by some of the older dialogue but not all of it, the confrontation between Hiccup and Stoick really shows that Mason can hold his own with the original script. It's more the original actor's obvious adlibs that sounded off with the new actors because well... They weren't adlibbed by the new ones. Plus it needed even more Toothless. Also, animation will always be the superior medium, your honour.

That being said, it was clearly made with love and respect. It turns out that what we needed was a little more of Dean DeBlois. 

8/10 (as opposed to the original's 10/10).

Toothless gets a 10/10.

"I really liked this movie, 8/10.

In this movie I had much bigger connection with Hiccup and I felt like Toothless wasn't character  but just a dragon. Toothless doesn't show his emotions as much as in original ([here you can see that he is basically a human inside of a dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5JHOYmfPpo)) which is fair considering this is cgi and not animated so it is much harder.

That being said, everything else was great, characters were done very well, some even better than in the original. 

Best moment was when Stoick said ""whatever happens, I'm proud of you son"" and Hiccup replied with something like ""That's the only thing that matters to me"".  Due to the fact that i lost my dad when I was 13 this was incredibly impactful for me so i even let a tear down my cheek.

"I’m sure I’m not the only one to rewatch the animated version before seeing this, and I highly recommend it because you will feel psychic *knowing* what happens next. That’s how closely it sticks to the source material.

Did they play it safe? Absolutely. No added subplots to pad out the runtime, no new characters, just very minor reimaginings. Only one removed sequence, and I think the biggest addition is Snotlout trying to win his dad’s approval?

Honestly, it’s a testament to how good the original is that this “remake” is 95% the same. And this was absolutely fine as a result. It didn’t reinvent the wheel, but it didn’t need to.

One (still minor) change was the dragons. Their designs were all modified to be a little more realistic (as much as dragons can be). More reptilian than their original counterparts.

A little disappointed none of the original voice actors had cameos (not counting Gerard Butler, of course). America Ferrera could’ve been Astrid’s mom. Maybe they’re saving them for the sequel.

I’d love to know the thoughts of someone who sees this version and then the animated one.",Im sure Im not only one rewatch animated version seeing highly recommend will feel psychic knowing happens next Thats closely sticks source material play safe Absolutely No added subplots pad runtime no new characters just very minor reimaginings Only one removed sequence think biggest addition Snotlout trying win dads approval Honestly testament good original remake same absolutely fine result didnt reinvent wheel didnt need One still minor change dragons designs modified little more realistic much dragons can More reptilian than original counterparts little disappointed none original voice actors cameos not counting Gerard Butler course America Ferrera couldve Astrids mom Maybe theyre saving sequel Id love know thoughts someone sees version animated one,Positive
"It’s not better than its animated counterpart. 

But you can feel this movie, while pretty close to a 1:1 remake, had a lot of people that loved the material. It felt like it came from a place of care, something Disney needs to pay attention to if they are continuing on their reimagining route. 

I’m glad Butler is back and I did like Astrid had more of a backstory to her. The score is just iconic.

"It was great. Some of the casting was literally perfect. Majority of the rest was near-perfect.

9/10. Hard to give it a 10/10 when the original movie exists (which is an 11/10!). 

Here is my main critique. Some of Hiccup's lines were delivered too sincerely rather than sarcastically. If you didn't know the original, you would think he was serious about some of his jokes. Biggest examples of this are 1) when he tells Gobber he's playing a dangerous game [(comparison)](https://youtu.be/cEqgJEkdIZI?t=36) and 2) when he talks about how he wants nothing more than to kill dragons. These lines are delivered too sincerely rather than with the more-obvious humor of Jay's original depiction that made Hiccup so iconic.

But for most of the movie I would say Hiccup was portrayed very well & it was one of the few remakes, possibly the *only* remake, that I truly enjoyed and was impressed by. Love how the dragons and atmosphere looked; this was awesome to see in theatres.",great Some casting literally perfect Majority rest nearperfect Hard give original movie exists main critique Some Hiccups lines delivered too sincerely rather than sarcastically didnt know original would think serious some jokes Biggest examples tells Gobber hes playing dangerous game comparison talks wants nothing more than kill dragons lines delivered too sincerely rather than moreobvious humor Jays original depiction made Hiccup so iconic most movie would say Hiccup portrayed very well one few remakes possibly only remake truly enjoyed impressed Love dragons atmosphere looked awesome see theatres,Positive

"This movie felt like a love letter to the original animated work.  Gerard Butler was outstanding.  I was curious how they were going to explain a biracial Astrid so the introduction of dragon fighters from all over the world gathering at Berk was a good addition.  And it’s not without precedent since we see different ethnicities in the sequels.  

They nailed Toothless-I like that they switched up the other dragons’ designs to make them look wilder/more intimidating but let’s face it, no one would be interested if they messed around with Toothless.  I did love that the  terrible terrors looked like winged chameleons.

I hope they have Cate Blanchett signed up for the sequels, we need to see Valka brought to life and she’s an outstanding actress.

Love the soundtrack-it’s been one of my favorite movie scores for years and I’m glad they didn’t mess with it and brought Jon Powell back on board.  The horn solos in Test Drive still give me chills.

My one quibble was leaving out the scene where Hiccup interacts with the pack of terrors.  One, it’s when he has his realization that dragons aren’t all bad-I think prior to that he believed Toothless had bonded with him out of necessity, not affection.  Two, it plants the seeds of how to defeat the queen.",movie felt like love letter original animated work Gerard Butler outstanding curious going explain biracial Astrid so introduction dragon fighters world gathering Berk good addition not without precedent since see different ethnicities sequels nailed ToothlessI like switched other dragons designs make look wildermore intimidating lets face no one would interested messed around Toothless love terrible terrors looked like winged chameleons hope Cate Blanchett signed sequels need see Valka brought life shes outstanding actress Love soundtrackits one favorite movie scores years Im glad didnt mess brought Jon Powell back board horn solos Test Drive still give chills one quibble leaving scene Hiccup interacts pack terrors One realization dragons arent badI think prior believed Toothless bonded necessity not affection Two plants seeds defeat queen,Positive

"I enjoyed the heck out of it. I went in mostly wanting to hear the score again in Dolby sound and would be happy if the rest was okay and I had a ton of fun. It's a shot for shot remake so nothing groundbreaking and I don't think it added anything meaningful to the HTTYD franchise but it was still a good time for me.

They did a great job of making a ""Live Action Cartoon"", like they stopped short of fully live action stylizing it and I think that's what makes a lot of the corniness still work. And it's obvious it was made with love, that was some lovely design work from set to costumes to the dragon redesigns.

Test Drive took my breath away as I expected it to. The score is still incredible.

It's entirely unnecessary as a movie and I've hated every live action version of something we've gotten so far except Cinderella. But if we have to be in this era of live action I guess then this is a good example of a way to do it.

- Gerard Butler killed it! I know he's the only main character reprising the role from the animated versions but he fully committed to the role and the movie is better for it
- The Toothless CGI is perfect and the flying scenes are great 
- Astrid, Snotlout, and Fishlegs moments hit better in the live action version
- It's 20 mins longer than the animated version but it is well-paced

LA and animation are two mediums with their own unique charm and I feel like they captured what made the animation special here. A lot of attention to detail, great CGI mixed with practical effects, this wasn’t just a cash grab, but a different approach to the story. 

Which is better will be up to personal preference, but the actors’ performances resonated with me slightly more here.

"I saw this on Tuesday and I get the criticism that it's pretty much a shot for shot remake of the animated movie. The first scene in particular I was struggling with as I couldn't get into the actors performances, are they doing an imitation?  Jay Baruchel didn't say it like that, etc.

Needless to say, once that opening scene passes ,I settled down and got in tune with the actors performances and the world of Berk being brought to life. The locations , the big sets, the brilliant CGI of the dragons, all brought to life to give this live action the feel of the original. 

All the moments that we love are there and the filmmakers didn't mess it up. Gerald Butler was so good as Stoick and the young actors more than stepped up into their roles. Dean really put his heart into this and I can see the subtle changes he did in trying to elevate the storytelling and ofc John Powell's score is just phenomenal. 

Overall, I had a great time and the filmmakers didn't let the fans down. It's a corporate film for sure but it's based on imo a perfect movie, so they couldn't go wrong with it.

"I was cautious about this because I heard it was a shot for shot remake, and I was not a fan of “The Lion King (2019)”, which was practically that.

I would give it a solid 7.5/10, and would possibly watch again. I can’t say that about many of these remakes.

"Yeah, this was fine. My Cinemark showed the original in their XD auditorium last summer for the Summer Kids Series so I’ve rewatched it fairly recently AND on a large screen. Because of that, this remake didn’t offer much to me but I didn’t hate it.

Sadly the strength is still in the animation. Once Toothless shows up and begins emoting like his animated counterpart, the film starts to shine. But only because the original was already perfect.

The cast was generally good, but kind of all over the place. Astrid at least felt like she was she was doing her own thing with the character without feeling like she had to mimic America Ferrera. Hiccup, however, read like someone who clearly had seen the original too many times and wanted to imitate Jay Baruchel but just couldn’t get the timing of his humor right. The first act in particular felt particularly forced with his line delivery. I don’t know if it actually got better as the film went on or if I just finally started to accept it.",Yeah fine Cinemark showed original XD auditorium last summer Summer Kids Series so Ive rewatched fairly recently large screen remake didnt offer much didnt hate Sadly strength still animation Toothless shows begins emoting like animated counterpart film starts shine only original already perfect cast generally good kind place Astrid least felt like own thing character without feeling like mimic America Ferrera Hiccup however read like someone clearly seen original too many times wanted imitate Jay Baruchel just couldnt get timing humor right first act particular felt particularly forced line delivery dont know actually got better film went just finally started accept,Positive

This movie understood that it was not going to surpass the original, but it felt like a great complementary piece to the HTTYD saga of films. I thought Toothless looked great and even in live action, I still bought into the connection between him and Hiccup .

"I am conflicted about this.

I think this is where some gaming terminology could help me get to the point faster: this is more of a remaster than a remake it that makes sense. 

It is the exactly the same thing Sony did with the Last of US series from PS4 to PS5.

Good things is, it captures the charm of the original movie. What works still works. 

And I don’t mind watch the old movie again just in super HD.

But there is something that works for animation that doesn’t quite fit live action. Toothless is more … subtle. I think they tamed a bit of its liveliness just to make it more grounded. The same thing goes for the whole movie, there is just some contradiction between those CG creatures and Game of Throne-esque realistic fantasy backdrop that doesn’t quite fit. I can’t pin point why but it sometimes irritates.

Overall, it is an enjoyable experience.",conflicted think some gaming terminology could help get point faster more remaster than remake makes sense exactly same thing Sony Last US series PS PS Good things captures charm original movie works still works dont mind watch old movie just super HD something works animation doesnt quite fit live action Toothless more subtle think tamed bit liveliness just make more grounded same thing goes whole movie just some contradiction CG creatures Game Throneesque realistic fantasy backdrop doesnt quite fit cant pin point sometimes irritates Overall enjoyable experience,Positive

"Pretty much the best case scenario for a live action remake, probably help that the original movie translates to live action well

- Mason Thames was very good as Hiccup. He doesn’t outdo Jay Baruchel for the comedic delivery but brings his own take to the character. He looks a little to “handsome” for movie 1 Hiccup but physical acting and line delivery goes a *long* way to alleviate this

- Gerald Butler perfectly reprises his role again. He was very strong in the comedic scenes he has which is typically something Butler excels at

- the movie actually has some decent lighting despite being a current year blockbuster

- The additions to the plot were generally a positive, like going more into the Viking’s culture or Snotlout’s running gag with his dad

"This was an amazing film. I absolutely love the HTTYD franchise (Still stand by it should‘ve won Best Animated Film and Best Score in 2010), and I think this film is a great addition to it. It hits the emotional notes it should hit, I found I had goosebumps maybe 3 or 4 times in the film. The acting and casting for me were perfect, regardless of a few changes since the casting of Hiccup alone (and Butler returning as Stoic) were so damn fantastic. Thames brings the energy needed for Hiccup, everything from the movements to the speech pattern. I’ll say with some lines I’m so used to Baruchel though and I was a bit thrown off (the “oooh I should’ve gone first…” line is delivered so perfect by Baruchel and it still makes me laugh every time).

  
The visual effects were also very top notch for me, and I loved the cinematography, it felt very massive and epic and didn’t feel neutered visually. And the props and costumes were outstanding, I loved how a lot of them were practical and 1:1 of the animated films most of the time. I think my only small complaint was being a bit let down by Test Drive, one of my favorite sequences ever. The music and everything hits for the most part, but it’s edited and shortened and just didn’t pack that full wallop the animated version gives you when Hiccup tosses the cheat sheet and decides to go for it. The camera felt a bit too janky at points, and I like how someone else described it in this post, like it was trying to play catch-up. Shouldve replicated the camera movements of the animated film if possible.

  
Anyway, this film was definitely a 9/10 for me. It pays total respect to the original (as it should since it’s the same director), but throws a few little new things in there that don’t really detract from the film.

Even some moments of destruction or even the sadness than comes from a war it looked so depressing. When the dragons sank most of their boats it was a classic moment of “they didn’t visually die but they went overboard” or “they didn’t die but they fell off a cliff”.

This is not bad, just saying. The type of movie just doesn’t feel too kids movie when it’s live action. The final fight scene of Hiccup and the dragon did look so action like it can be perfectly taken from other type of dragon movie and it’s perfectly believable.

It was too good.",anyone else think not feel like kids movie based kids movie yes Everyone took kids see even animated movies final scene fighting big dragon got bit surprised one other level Add couple more visual deaths whole VikingFantasy movie Even some moments destruction even sadness than comes war looked so depressing dragons sank most boats classic moment didnt visually die went overboard didnt die fell cliff not bad just saying type movie just doesnt feel too kids movie live action final fight scene Hiccup dragon look so action like can perfectly taken other type dragon movie perfectly believable too good,Positive
"The first 15 minutes were so jarring in acting. I for a minute wanted to walk out if that was going to be the whole case. My girlfriend loves the franchise and it surprised me when she mentioned the same thing after we were out.


It evened out and got better, but still I had the thought “what’s the purpose for this?” the entire time. Lilo & Stitch made more sense to me than HTTYD. Ultimately, as with all remakes, but this one left me with the same feeling like Lion King with a paycheck necessary feeling. It’s obvious they want to remake the trilogy. I just don’t see the point in wasting time if you’re not going to do anything with it. If you MUST remake something, bring a reason for it to the table. I loathe shot for shot remakes that do next to nothing and this one just left a sour taste in my mouth after. 6/10",first minutes so jarring acting minute wanted walk going whole case girlfriend loves franchise surprised mentioned same thing evened got better still thought whats purpose entire time Lilo Stitch made more sense than HTTYD Ultimately remakes one left same feeling like Lion King paycheck necessary feeling obvious want remake trilogy just dont see point wasting time youre not going anything MUST remake something bring reason table loathe shot shot remakes next nothing one just left sour taste mouth,Positive

"honestly the movie holds such a dear personal note to me that i still cried multiple times despite knowing the whole story by heart. but i will say that some of the shots for test drive threw me off and kind of made the entire scene really short imo? like it feels like the camera is trying to catch up to the flying? if that makes sense. there's also a couple of instances where i felt like the tension in the original was removed (due in part to the editing changes in the music), and of course there's the scene that everyone has talked about, which is the part with toothless and the terrible terrors. 

i think when you have a movie that is so nostalgic and good as the original httyd, there is a lot to be nitpicked on in a live action movie. overall the live action still ignited a lot of nostalgia in me, but i'll probably go home and watch the original animation film and prefer that over this.",honestly movie holds such dear personal note still cried multiple times despite knowing whole story heart will say some shots test drive threw kind made entire scene really short imo like feels like camera trying catch flying makes sense theres also couple instances felt like tension original removed due part editing changes music course theres scene everyone talked part toothless terrible terrors think movie so nostalgic good original httyd lot nitpicked live action movie overall live action still ignited lot nostalgia ill probably go home watch original animation film prefer,Positive

I felt like they didn't have as much personality in the animated movie, and scenes with them were extremely rushed and I could tell that the animators intentionally obscured Toothless' face for a lot of the film.

"One thing I liked in the live action better than the animated was how it fleshed out Astrid's attraction to Hiccup.

One of my gripes from the animated was Astrid's sudden switch up after Romantic Flight. From hating and bullying Hiccup, she now suddenly likes him just like that.

The live action didn't change much. But I appreciated that they gave Astrid some backstory (how she has to work hard for everything bc she came from nothing) which explains her hate for Hiccup. And yeah, she still switches up after Romantic Flight in the live action BUT idk, it doesnt feel as sudden and jarring as the animated.",One thing liked live action better than animated fleshed Astrids attraction Hiccup One gripes animated Astrids sudden switch Romantic Flight hating bullying Hiccup now suddenly likes just like live action didnt change much appreciated gave Astrid some backstory work hard everything bc came nothing explains hate Hiccup yeah still switches Romantic Flight live action idk doesnt feel sudden jarring animated,Positive

"It's a pointless remake. It is literally a scene for scene remake with an additional padding of 30 minutes, thus damaging the pacing from the nicely tight 90 minutes of the animated movie. 

The only redeeming factor is that at least it doesn't ruin the story and themes like a certain Lilo and Stitch remake.

That is the thing with remakes. If you are just doing it to the exact like this How to Train your Dragon Remake, what is the point when you can watch the superior original?

"HTTYD is one of my favorite films of all time. The franchise means a lot to me. I think the original is a masterpiece of cinema, storytelling, art, music, etc etc.

I cannot stand live action remakes. I think it’s usually a money-grab, and appealing to an audience who refuse to take animation seriously or give it a chance, despite it having some of the best storytelling in media. When this was announced, my exact response was “can we please stop doing live action remakes of perfect animated films? anyway I’m already in the theater.”

I just watched it today. I was… pleasantly surprised? I think overall, they did a really great job of capturing the magic of the original films. A lot of it was certainly shot for shot, word for word, inflection for inflection from the original, but it worked? I will also say I think there were a few moments that this new version actually did Better than its animated counterpart (I.e. certain line deliveries, scene changes, etc).

I respect the amount of care that went into this film. It was made with the understanding of how beautiful the original was. This wasn’t trying to do it better, like a lot of live actions attempt, it was just creating another medium for a beautiful story. It’s the first time I’ve been satisfied with a live action version of something, even if (of course) I still prefer the original.

I remember hearing about how the director said something akin to “well, they’re gonna make it live action anyway, let me make sure I have a hand in it” which I think is why it still felt so magical and held respect towards the original.",HTTYD one favorite films time franchise means lot think original masterpiece cinema storytelling art music etc etc cannot stand live action remakes think usually moneygrab appealing audience refuse take animation seriously give chance despite some best storytelling media announced exact response can please stop live action remakes perfect animated films anyway Im already theater just watched today pleasantly surprised think overall really great job capturing magic original films lot certainly shot shot word word inflection inflection original worked will also say think few moments new version actually Better than animated counterpart Ie certain line deliveries scene changes etc respect amount care went film made understanding beautiful original wasnt trying better like lot live actions attempt just creating another medium beautiful story first time Ive satisfied live action version something even course still prefer original remember hearing director said something akin well theyre gonna make live action anyway let make sure hand think still felt so magical held respect towards original,Positive
"I watched it and I come from a place of obsession with series (from the movies to the tv shows) and I thought it was great! It made me particularly excited for the sequel because I can already feel that this is more of the groundwork movie to set up the franchise to a more fantastical world. I would even bet that maybe the second movie would translate better in a live action medium. 

As a fan of the franchise it felt odd at first to hear everything word by word, scene by scene. But I think given that Dean Deblois directed this movie makes me think that it's his chance to add new layers to the story we already know. As long as the original directors are touching this remake, I feel somewhat confident in the story they're telling.

Acting isn't the best but they can only get better from here! I have hopes and expectations and it feels surreal to reimagine this world I knew and feel it closer through the remake.",watched come place obsession series movies tv shows thought great made particularly excited sequel can already feel more groundwork movie set franchise more fantastical world would even bet maybe second movie would translate better live action medium fan franchise felt odd first hear everything word word scene scene think given Dean Deblois directed movie makes think chance add new layers story already know long original directors touching remake feel somewhat confident story theyre telling Acting isnt best can only get better hopes expectations feels surreal reimagine world knew feel closer remake,Positive

"The movie was good, but some details that were in the animated movie were missing. When they wanted to see if the dragons are fireproof with their own fire, they covered the little dragon's mouth.

What I didn't like. 

On the subject of the cast, I hated that they changed Astrid from being a pretty blonde woman with white skin and blue eyes to a black woman with brown hair. The forced inclusion was very noticeable, apart from the fact that her acting and interpretation was shit. You can see that it was funny that her parents are famous actors. It's because she was there and because she was black, she almost covered minority actors.

"Bit late to the party but HTTYD is my absolute favorite movie and I really enjoyed the trilogy as well. That being said, as everyone else mentioned, I thought the live action did a good job adapting the animation. I was also pretty skeptical about the live action because you know the reputation of live actions…but I can confidently say I wasn’t disappointed watching the movie! The score is AMAZING and top tier as per usual. I’m glad that they kept the score pretty much the same for the important scenes. Other things I thought the live action did well:

- The live action was definitely more Hiccup centered than Toothless. I love how the movie focused more on Hiccup and put less attention on Toothless, and you can actually see this in some scenes where the camera focuses more on Hiccup and shows hims rather then panning to Toothless. Also they kept the scar!!!
- Hiccup realizing he lost a limb was definitely way more impactful compared to the animation. Not that there isn’t wrong with the animation, but it’s much more emotional and impactful in this movie.
- I appreciate that they didn’t change much in this movie compared to the original. It has a good balance of keeping things the same but also adding new things that doesn’t ruin the movie for us original lovers.
- Gerard Butler really carrying the show with his acting and voice. I love the fact that they used the same voice actor for the live action. Seeing Stoick as Gerard Butler is just the perfect fit.
- I actually liked the scene of the meeting in the Meade Hall and how they emphasis that the Vikings came from different areas and traveled to Berk! It was a nice addition and appreciate seeing the diversity :)
- Astrid saying “Go” in the animation makes me cringe every single time I watch it in the animation so I’m glad they made it better in this movie hahaha

Things I thought could’ve been better or didn’t really like about the live action:

- They took out the scene where Hiccup realizes dragons aren’t fireproof on the inside! It’s a great foreshadowing to how Hiccup goes on to defeat the Red Death so i was sad they took that out…
- They also took out the scene where Hiccup gets stuck on the saddle so he has to take Toothless back to Berk and they run into Astrid…
- The acting was a bit lackluster from our dragon rider gang. I felt like it felt a bit awkward at times in certain scenes or didn’t feel the impact/emotion from the actors in important scenes.
- It’s longer then the animation but I don’t know why the pacing felt off time to time during the movie. Could it be because the animation does a better job at transitioning? But anyways, I thought the pacing could’ve been better.

"Everyone keeps saying it was a scene for scene remake but it really wasn't. They tried and there are a lot of scenes taken from the original and the plot was identical but that doesn't change the fact that they did change things enough to alter the essence of the story.

It feels like it was made with love and care and it is a mostly faithful retelling of the animated film's plot but... It's just not the same. The people in charge of retelling the story chose to focus and elaborate on elements from the original that I personally didn't think needed to be emphasized and chose to remove/alter classic sequences that I personally wish they hadn't. Where was Toothless? *Who* is Toothless? Who is Hiccup? Since when is Astrid running the show? The vision just doesn't work for *me.* I appreciate how closely they tried to mimic the original and how hard they worked to create a truly faithful adaptation but in the end for me as a die hard fan of the original animated film they just strayed a bit too far from the core elements of what I loved in the original.

I loved hiccup's actor once we got about 25% of the way into the film and I got used to him and I loved Fishlegs but the other's were very hit or miss for me. Somehow at times it felt like they filmed a cheesy rendition of HTTYD that ended up more telling you what you should know rather than showing you.

Scene for scene adaptations only work if you actually adapt the movie scene for scene...

And honestly even the music was off for me. There wasn't as much subtlety in the sound design as in the animated film. Here it felt like there was always an epic score in the background and it didn't work for me. It desensitized my ears for when the music should really've stood out.

I know I'm nitpicking.

"I actually didn’t like this movie. The acting was ok at best for everybody but Gerard Butler. He was the only stand out. Almost all of the personality and charm the characters had in the original is gone.

Some of the changes they made didn’t work for me. That scene with Astrid telling Hiccup she’s gonna take his house or Hiccup telling her not to get involved because Stoic respects her instead of asking her to make sure toothless doesn’t get found out like in the original was stupid as hell. Making Astrid take charge instead of Hiccup for the climax was weird as well. 

Felt really rushed at points even though it’s basically a 1:1 remake. The flying scene doesn’t hit anywhere as hard as the original as well. Also the cutting of some of the best lines from the original is weird as hell. How are you gonna cut “We’re Vikings. It’s an occupational hazard”?

Almost forgot that they cut the terrible terror scene from the original. The scene that helped hiccup later on figure out how to stop the queen.

Some of the few changes I actually liked was hiccup training them throughout the entire night instead of an hour or two. Astrid helping stormfly then getting caught by toothless. Snotlout was better than in the original. 

Honestly the music the only consistently good thing about this movie. I know I probably sound whiny, but the original movie is one of my favorite films of all time.

We already know to like Astrid because she’s talented and brave and ultimately understanding, you don’t have to make her more aggressive and ambitious for us to like her.

"Respectfully, I’m going to have to disagree. The original film animators spent 2 years (if I remember correctly) on studying flight mechanics before applying them to the film. It can definitely be evident in the film with the way the dragons flew, it felt like watching exactly how a bird flys. However, I cannot say the same for the live action remake. In the live action there were several animation mistakes/flaws that I wasn’t a fan of when it came to the dragons flying. 1) It looked like they were swimming through the air, not flying. Using water as a comparison for flight is commonly what animators are taught, because they are both substances that cannot be seen (water and air) but that can be moved through. As people, we only really can relate to moving through water so we use that as a frame of reference. However, this makes it look like the bodies of the dragons are not actually being supported by the air underneath them, instead it looks like they are moving through the air mechanically and too easily. 2) The way they flapped their wings was not accurate to how animals that fly actually would flap their wings. Nearly every wing flap was a full blown “reach all the way up and all the way down for lift.” In reality, those kind of wing beats are only done when lifting off or needing to speed up, but this was done in the movie for dragons that were even just casually flying. This added to the “looking like dragons were swimming” effect and it didn’t look like they were really flying at all. In the original animation, there was a lot more gliding than flapping, which is way more accurate for a larger creature (think pterosaurs or even birds of prey) and they didn’t do the full up down motion but instead mostly down and then slight up, so that the air can remain cushioned underneath the wings rather than creating drag and falling whenever the wings are fully lifted 3) There were a few times where Toothless’s wings moved asynchronously, especially during the time when he was injured at the beginning and kept falling as well as during the final boss scene. I can understand during the injury bit somewhat, but it felt more like his front wings were the ones that were injured instead of his tail. In the original adaptation, he was gaining lift with his wings and it was clear that his injured tail was causing him drag. But in this movie he was crash landing over and over again and it didn’t feel like a tail drag issue. It felt like a wing injury issue. Bird wings move simultaneously by reflex. In the live action it almost felt like each wing had its own brain. Overall, I didn’t like the flight mechanics, and it was the main thing that attracted me to the originals because rarely ever does flight ever feel *real* in animation like it did there. I understand it’s a fantasy movie, but the point is they failed to achieve what they did during the first adaptation, and it felt like instead of studying flight mechanics like what was done previously, they just ultra studied the movements of the previous movie to match it exactly but the effect felt unrealistic and mechanical. I do appreciate how they stayed loyal to the script overall in the film, however, and the CGI was really impressive otherwise.",Respectfully Im going disagree original film animators spent years remember correctly studying flight mechanics applying film can definitely evident film way dragons flew felt like watching exactly bird flys However cannot say same live action remake live action several animation mistakesflaws wasnt fan came dragons flying looked like swimming air not flying Using water comparison flight commonly animators taught substances cannot seen water air can moved people only really can relate moving water so use frame reference However makes look like bodies dragons not actually supported air underneath instead looks like moving air mechanically too easily way flapped wings not accurate animals fly actually would flap wings Nearly every wing flap full blown reach way way lift reality kind wing beats only done lifting needing speed done movie dragons even just casually flying added looking like dragons swimming effect didnt look like really flying original animation lot more gliding than flapping way more accurate larger creature think pterosaurs even birds prey didnt full motion instead mostly slight so air can remain cushioned underneath wings rather than creating drag falling whenever wings fully lifted few times Toothlesss wings moved asynchronously especially time injured beginning kept falling well final boss scene can understand injury bit somewhat felt more like front wings ones injured instead tail original adaptation gaining lift wings clear injured tail causing drag movie crash landing didnt feel like tail drag issue felt like wing injury issue Bird wings move simultaneously reflex live action almost felt like each wing own brain Overall didnt like flight mechanics main thing attracted originals rarely ever flight ever feel real animation like understand fantasy movie point failed achieve first adaptation felt like instead studying flight mechanics like done previously just ultra studied movements previous movie match exactly effect felt unrealistic mechanical appreciate stayed loyal script overall film however CGI really impressive otherwise,Positive

In the original toothless is the only one powerful enough to knock it down before it gets back up and spreads its wing.

Which is fine, because in the next 2 films they really flesh out her character (+ the TV shows).

But the reality is the extra padding of the live action gave Hiccup and Astrid more time to breathe. For example, instead of her dismissing him at the table about having already read the Book of Dragons, she actually tells him her motivations. She's also much more intrigued at Hiccup saying she should be chief/she's the son Stoick always wanted. And in the live action she berates all of them for messing around during dragon training (is this a joke to all of you?) as opposed to just Hiccup in the original (Is this a joke to you?)

"The live action little mermaid also made Eric and Ariel's relationship feel a lot more real. Especially with Eric being more of an explorer/into the sea, they made him such a good foil to Ariel in that way. They felt more like equals and you also understood why they liked each other by the end of it, and it helped that the actors had so much chemistry.

The original kind of falls flat in that it's a very simple boy meets girl, falls in love kind of tale. I vastly prefer (if we have to have remakes) adaptations that actually put effort into making a new story that retains the original meaning. 

But also I hate the disrespect that animation gets, the original story isn't less real because it wasn't shot with live actors. And animation sometimes tells certain stories in the best possible way, to the point where if it's recreated in live action it's not as good and might as well not exist (for example the lion King). Why make something new if not to add to it in a meaningful way? The answer of course being that these companies are getting a lot more creatively bankrupt.

To add to it, Hiccup said something like everyone has something special.

She tries so hard for most of the movie to be the best and now we see her not just working with the team, but bringing them together. 

The one time in training she’s supposed to be working as a team, she tells the girl to shut up and every other time someone comes over to her, she’s trying to shake them off.

"Bruh, you look into your soul right now and tell me that if you saw a good looking guy get his crew off a fiery ship and then climb back on to save his dog, you wouldn’t fall in love with him? Ariel may have been initially attracted to him based on his looks, but him going back for the dog was wonderful and then the kindness he shows her when they meet later and he brings her back to the castle would have solidified it. 

He fell in love with her because of how happy and interested in everything she was. He says to Grimsby that he didn’t want to marry just to marry, he wanted to find the right girl. He wanted to be in love. He probably also liked how weird she was, like hanging upside down off the carriage, pulling the puppets of the guy’s hand, brushing her hair with a fork, etc. Eric probably had a hard time finding a girl who wasn’t snotty or after his money. And Ariel was completely herself. She was also just as brave as him, swimming after him, fighting Ursula, ( Think you’d be brave enough to grab Ursula by her shoulders while she’s holding a trident, as a distraction?), and fighting off a shark to help Flounder when he got stuck on the ship. 

They’re actually perfect for each other. 

Finally, giving up her voice as payment wasn’t “ giving up her autonomy “ for a man, it’s Ursula’s trick to handicap Ariel so that she loses. Ursula was cheating.  Ariel was supposed to fail and be awkward without the chance to explain herself, but Eric loved her for herself. Ariel was nothing but her authentic self. She couldn’t lie or fake her way through it, all she could do and be was herself. 

It’s actually beautiful if you think about it. Eric fell in love with her for what was inside of her. Ursula was banking on Ariel being stupid, but Eric saw only a sweet and happy girl, who was more interested in the town and himself, instead of money.

"Down in Aussie, Fantastic Four actually held alright at 43% week 2 drop, which puts it exactly in the middle of all MCU Weekend 2 % drops.  

That said it's easier to maintain a lower % drop when the movie doesn't even open in the top 5 openings of the year. (FF opened as the 7th highest opening of the year down here).  

But as a silver lining, as with international it is now the highest Fantastic Four movie (Unadjusted for inflation) so yay for that and it's already almost closed the gap on both other MCU movies from this year and should pass them both in the next week or two without too much sweat.  

As usual down here we also have some Indian cinema making it's way into the weekly charts with both Chal Mera Putt 4 opening in number 5 and Saiyaara at number 8 after 3 weeks of release. An Indian film holding around that long in the top 10 is fairly rare and they put out those numbers off under 100 screens.

The general audience doesn't give a shit about any of that. Yes you may need to reassess your style when refreshing your brand but that isn't why the MCU is failing next to say... weak characters and dull concepts.

Like I don't give a shit about the Thunderbolts and the marketing didn't tell me anything about them but **ha-ha** they all run and shoot. So Suicide Squad but without anything quirky like a fucking shark or maniac pixie clown girl. Grrrreattt. 

Then there's that z-tier supershit that Marvel needs to fucking delete. Seriously of all the fucking superclones Sentry is the worst, a bad joke that didn't just fail completely at humor but then forgot it was even a joke. Not that I'd know anything about how he was actually going to be handled in the movie from the marketing. 

Not that I blame the marketing, reading the actual spoilers doesn't make me feel I missed much.

Which has been the problem over and over again with the MCU lately. 

Even what's good they make just baffling choices with. Like why do you take your strongest debut outside Black Panther and decide oh yeah for the sequel instead of more super saiyan girl blasting starships and flying around at mach 10 you're going to go with.... Freaky fucking Friday? Because **ha-ha** other girls have used the Marvel name? Yeah that was totally going to work on an audience who barely knows who Ms Marvel and Ms Nextwave are. Also totally a Wii U situation not calling Captain Marvel 2. 

As for First Steps well I dare suggest they were getting better but when Reed started talking about ""family dinner"" in the trailers they needed to immediately smash cut to some absolute disaster around the table with them all screaming at each other. Because the FF are Marvel's 'first family' because Kirby and Lee had the great innovation to write some actual fucking people with problems, concerns, and squabbles in contrast to the Justice League and early Silver Age heroes in general being immaculate (and often high handed) paladins of justice. The FF are a family because they aren't just a hero team up not because they exude any sort of wholesome classic family values.

"Hell, it's been that way for quite some time. Last year the 4 top worldwide grossing movies were at the very least sequels, and the top 10 were much the same as this year. The year before of the top 10, I think only one wasn't a reboot, sequel, or based on a video game, toy line, or book was Full River Red, which I'm not sure released in theaters outside of China. 

There were a couple others that seemed like they only released in China in 2020 and 2021, but without those you have to go back nearly a decade for Inside Out and Secret Life of Pets for anything that would be considered original IP (I'm not counting Bohemian Rhapsody since, while it wasn't based on a book or anything, I'm not sure basing it on an actual person counts as original...)

Edit: In fact, it looks like the last time more than 3 (and at least half) of the top grossing movies weren't sequels, reboots, part of franchises, etc. was 2000, with Gladiator, Cast Away, What Women Want, Dinosaur, and What Lies Beneath (which I don't *think* was published before the movie...)",Hell way quite some time Last year top worldwide grossing movies very least sequels top much same year year top think only one wasnt reboot sequel based video game toy line book Full River Red Im not sure released theaters outside China couple others seemed like only released China without go back nearly decade Inside Secret Life Pets anything would considered original IP Im not counting Bohemian Rhapsody since wasnt based book anything Im not sure basing actual person counts original Edit fact looks like last time more than least half top grossing movies werent sequels reboots part franchises etc Gladiator Cast Away Women Want Dinosaur Lies Beneath dont think published movie,Positive

"How much does the target audience play into the turnout? The build-up to Infinity War/Endgame took 11 years and 22 films (23 if you include Far From Home which released just after Endgame) to come to completion. You're looking at an audience that watched Iron Man and Captain America when they were in elementary school and then Endgame when they were in/graduating from college. With Endgame and the films that came out afterwards, the audience then lost the Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Thor that they grew up supporting.  
  
Obviously there's space for new characters and heroes, but each new film is PG-13 and targeted at a younger audience. The films have also become very formulaic at this point, there are now supporting TV shows, and there's a constant churn of new characters getting introduced to replace the cast that bowed out in the hopes of finding the new marketable super-team. Add in the multiverse stuff and the people who aren't paying close attention have no idea what's going on and what characters are active.  
  
But ultimately, the core cast completed their stories and the kids who became attached to them are well into adulthood at this point. Those adults aren't as willing to watch 20+ PG-13 movies and TV shows setting up a new MCU storyline when the one they cared about has already finished. That doesn't mean that those people don't care about the MCU anymore, it just means that they're less invested these days and if they're going to watch one of these films, they're only going to turn out for the big ones with an ensemble cast. And they'll likely get the cliff notes of all the new characters before they watch it.  
  
Or actually, another random thought - all of these films end up on the rather cheap Disney+ platform within 2-3 months, so if people do care enough to watch these films, they're likely just waiting for them to hit the streaming platform.",much target audience play turnout buildup Infinity WarEndgame took years films include Far Home released just Endgame come completion Youre looking audience watched Iron Man Captain America elementary school Endgame ingraduating college Endgame films came afterwards audience lost Iron Man Captain America Black Widow Hawkeye Thor grew supporting Obviously theres space new characters heroes each new film PG targeted younger audience films also become very formulaic point now supporting TV shows theres constant churn new characters getting introduced replace cast bowed hopes finding new marketable superteam Add multiverse stuff people arent paying close attention no idea whats going characters active ultimately core cast completed stories kids became attached well adulthood point adults arent willing watch PG movies TV shows setting new MCU storyline one cared already finished doesnt mean people dont care MCU anymore just means theyre less invested days theyre going watch one films theyre only going turn big ones ensemble cast theyll likely get cliff notes new characters watch actually another random thought films end rather cheap Disney platform within months so people care enough watch films theyre likely just waiting hit streaming platform,Positive

"The issue isn’t the superhero genre. Deadpool and Wolverine made over $1 billion last year, GotG3 made over $800 million in 2023, The Batman made over $700 million in 2022 and Superman is doing pretty well at almost $600 million. Clearly there is still a healthy appetite for the genre. The real issues were more complex than that. For Marvel, the hype for the MCU had died down after the massive payoff that was Endgame and instead of building connective tissue to hype up the following movies and generate interest again, Marvel put out a slew of mid projects with no sense of direction for where the franchise was going. The hype of the Avengers films carried a lot of the more mid Phase 1 - 3 MCU movies to big success and there was nothing like that post Endgame until recently. 

In terms of DC, they had been in freefall since the failure of Justice League, completely aimless with no sense of direction at all, throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. James Gunn announcing the rebooted universe sealed the deal for the final DCEU movies, nobody wanted to invest in a movie in a franchise they know is dying ahead of time. Thunderbolts and F4 are still feeling the effects of Marvel’s bad decision making even though they’re being praised as the best Marvel movies in years. I think it’s moreso that people are more wary of mediocre superhero movies than they were during the 2010s, but when the movie is good the audience (usually) still shows up",issue isnt superhero genre Deadpool Wolverine made billion last year GotG made million Batman made million Superman pretty well almost million Clearly still healthy appetite genre real issues more complex than Marvel hype MCU died massive payoff Endgame instead building connective tissue hype following movies generate interest Marvel put slew mid projects no sense direction franchise going hype Avengers films carried lot more mid Phase MCU movies big success nothing like post Endgame recently terms DC freefall since failure Justice League completely aimless no sense direction throwing anything wall see sticks James Gunn announcing rebooted universe sealed deal final DCEU movies nobody wanted invest movie franchise know dying ahead time Thunderbolts F still feeling effects Marvels bad decision making even though theyre praised best Marvel movies years think moreso people more wary mediocre superhero movies than s movie good audience usually still shows,Positive
"Hard disagree. I can't stand people trying to use this argument. The problem isn't superhero movie fatigue, the problem is that they keep making bad movies and shows. the movies are shit. It isn't any more complicated than that. You make bad movie after bad movie and people stop looking forward to your movies. If there is so much fatigue, why are there so many that i look forward to? Peacemaker, invincible, the boys; these are all examples of stuff i am waiting to see. i am not looking for to some new 'woke' boring marvel movie based on comics nobody likes in the first place, and then changed to be even worse than that. 

Take ironheart. Nobody liked those comics. Like nobody at all. That is just a fact. Yet they chose that out of the million other choices they had, to make a big series and create a new member of the mcu. That is already boring and lame. But then on top of that, they didn't even adapt her. They made her something completely different than her own comic. They changed everything about her character into something worse. Then the show very predictably bombs and people like you show up talking 'bout superhero fatique. the problem is that the show is bad. It is jsut that simple. On top of just being bad, it makes fans angry. This was hundreds of millions of dollars and the greater part of a decade wasted on something that nobody wanted that could have been used to make something people would love. So it's more than just the show is bad and I don't like it, we have actually been deprived of something we would gladly pay for.

The wrong people are in charge, and until that changes we will keep getting crap movies and shows. Even movies people end up actually liking, like fantastic 4, they are still on shaky ground. It still feels like someone who is out of touch is humoring some of the variables that the target audience says are important to make the kinds of movies they love and when the movies do succeed they don't actually understand what about it made that so. They are dancing on the edge of failure and people call it good enough.

The casuals might be tired of superheros, but there is a huge audience that is ready and eager for more, and that audience has the most disposable wealth to spend on such things. Make what the fans want and they will give you money. It doesn't get any simpler than that. The fans never wanted ironheart, it was always going to fail. Even in a thread talking about how fantastic 4 made nearly 400 million bucks you are over here saying people don't want to watch superhero movies any more. That is direct proof that you are wrong, whether the movie is considered a financial success or not. 400 million is not nothing and it certainly justifies them to keep making more movies, which is why that is exactly what they are going to keep doing.",Hard disagree cant stand people trying use argument problem isnt superhero movie fatigue problem keep making bad movies shows movies shit isnt more complicated than make bad movie bad movie people stop looking forward movies so much fatigue so many look forward Peacemaker invincible boys examples stuff waiting see not looking some new woke boring marvel movie based comics nobody likes first place changed even worse than Take ironheart Nobody liked comics Like nobody just fact Yet chose million other choices make big series create new member mcu already boring lame top didnt even adapt made something completely different than own comic changed everything character something worse show very predictably bombs people like show talking bout superhero fatique problem show bad jsut simple top just bad makes fans angry hundreds millions dollars greater part decade wasted something nobody wanted could used make something people would love So more than just show bad dont like actually deprived something would gladly pay wrong people charge changes will keep getting crap movies shows Even movies people end actually liking like fantastic still shaky ground still feels like someone touch humoring some variables target audience says important make kinds movies love movies succeed dont actually understand made so dancing edge failure people call good enough casuals might tired superheros huge audience ready eager more audience most disposable wealth spend such things Make fans want will give money doesnt get simpler than fans never wanted ironheart always going fail Even thread talking fantastic made nearly million bucks saying people dont want watch superhero movies more direct proof wrong whether movie considered financial success not million not nothing certainly justifies keep making more movies exactly going keep,Negative

I think they’d have been better off not jumping directly into a new saga and instead taking a path more like Gunn has with the DCU — make movies based on the best scripts you have, see what heroes and stories gain momentum, and build on them. From there they could figure out how to bring all of that together which would be when the new saga took shape.

My understanding is that is probably closer to how it worked the first time around. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen it mentioned a few times that even when they had the Thanos post credit scene after Avengers they still hadn’t actually decided on that as a direction, it was more just meant as a nod to fans and they eventually decided to roll with it (likely because it was so positively received).",Yeah think big issue stopped feeling organic think theyd better not jumping directly new saga instead taking path more like Gunn DCU make movies based best scripts see heroes stories gain momentum build could figure bring together would new saga took shape understanding probably closer worked first time around Im pretty sure Ive seen mentioned few times even Thanos post credit scene Avengers still hadnt actually decided direction more just meant nod fans eventually decided roll likely so positively received,Positive

So many people were confounded that Wanda was evil in Dr. Strange 2. So many people were uninterested in The Marvels because they didn't know who Monica Rambeau or Kamala Khan were. People didn't know who Elijah was in Captain America: Brave New World, which made that movie even harder to connect with. And what's going to happen when casual fans see Hulk's son show up in a movie? The idea of not knowing about these types of things certainly got some people to subscribe to D+ to stay in the loop, but they lost a lot of the casual movie fans over it. A lot of my friends and family really liked the MCU and we'd go see all of the movies together, but they didn't like it enough to subscribe to a whole new streaming service, and even if they did, they are busy and don't have time to watch a dozen new shows. 

And some of the shows were big enough flops that we'll probably never get follow-ups on stuff that should be really major. Like, Emilia Clarke's character from the Nick Fury show flew off at the end of the series with the powers of multiple avengers, including Captain Marvel's! She's a major force out there now, but we'll probably never see her again, and if we do, all the people who didn't watch the show are going to be completely baffled that there's a flying skrull with Groot powers.

"Demon Slayer is insanely popular. Its manga sales are incredible as well and I think a large part is that it is relatively short. The manga finished in 2020, when the first movie was released. So if you got interested in it, you could just go get a completed series/series that was about to wrap up and you could experience the ending as it came out.

It sits just below Dragon Ball and Naruto in volume sales, with a fraction of the number of volumes. And sits comfortably ahead of other recent popular franchises like AOT, JJK, MHA. Those three+ demon slayer are the only manga started past 2010 (and I am being nice to AOT and including it as it is 2009) that are 100 million+ volumes sold club.

"For  anyone who's actually interested in learning more about Galactus in the comics, here's a [gallery](https://imgur.com/a/HCgvvvp) of just a few examples from over the years, going all the way back to the first appearance arc and all the way to modern stuff. 

Galactus can be big enough to eat a planet like a cookie, but very rarely has been shown doing so. He's a cosmic abstract entity, the Devourer, a role in the Marvel cosmology that serves to help maintain the cosmic balance, and one that persists across the various incarnations of the Marvel multiverse (called Firmaments). 

Despite being able to appear however he wants, Galactus has been remarkably consistent across the years, typically ranging from a few dozen feet up to about 500-1000 on the high end. He uses a massive ship to process planets into food, but doesn't need it to do so, instead using it to purify and expedite the process. Why does he do this if he can also just become enormous and eat planets? Because comic book writers want him to, and they want him to do it that way 99.9% of the time. 

If you want a Watsonian explanation for it, just say it's incredibly inefficient for him to do so. Some writers have probably said as much at some point, but I can't be bothered to check.",anyone whos actually interested learning more Galactus comics heres gallery just few examples years going way back first appearance arc way modern stuff Galactus can big enough eat planet like cookie very rarely shown so Hes cosmic abstract entity Devourer role Marvel cosmology serves help maintain cosmic balance one persists across various incarnations Marvel multiverse called Firmaments Despite able appear however wants Galactus remarkably consistent across years typically ranging few dozen feet high end uses massive ship process planets food doesnt need so instead using purify expedite process can also just become enormous eat planets comic book writers want want way time want Watsonian explanation just say incredibly inefficient so Some writers probably said much some point cant bothered check,Positive

Imagine you're operating a business which offers a specific product to the general consumer marketplace (in this particular case it's movie theater seats, but the pattern applies to any obsolete product of a dying industry from horse-drawn carriages to typewriters to live music) which you must sell at a particular volume in order to cover your fixed overheads and remain profitable. For one reason or another you find that you're no longer selling at the required volume, so you have to increase prices (both for tickets and concessions) and/or lower the quality of the product (i.e. understaffed, poorly maintained theaters with less diverse offerings) to make up for the falling demand. Of course, increased prices and a poorer product just drives away customers even more, which forces you to further increase prices and cut costs, which further drives down demand...

And YES we absolutely are living in a bubble here. So what did you do that got outside that bubble? And also might present yourself as either a small child or parent or a small child NOT the above profile which isn't going to be caught dead at a kids movie. 

Like I only really get ads when I'm at work because I can't put ublock on work computers but still watch youtube while I'm pretending to work. Maybe its the space videos or old animation clips I watch tickling the algorithim or maybe I'm just dead obviously in my late 30s and thus of prime parenting years even though I myself am single with no kids. 

The real kicker though? I still miss PLENTY of move ads. I miss them for failed movies, and I miss them for big hits. Like I know there's some F1 movie coming out but I can't tell you a damn thing about it. If it succeeds or say Superman (which I saw within hours of the trailer drop) fails what does that mean? Did one of them fail to market enough? Or maybe **just maybe** did all of them receive pretty normal marketing spends using fairly orthodox tactics to try and sell themselves?

"Then perhaps my argument is being misconstrued as well. The original comment was about the trailer and marketing campaign for the movie.

Like Pulp Fiction, it's a disjointed narrative that's difficult to summarize without giving the whole thing away, but unlike Pulp Fiction, it's quiet and peaceful, which also means there's fewer ""money shots"" for the trailer.

I also, you'll notice, didn't say the movie was pretentious and Pulp Fiction isn't. I said the audience for this film was pretentious which was meant to be a self-deprecating jab. Because, again, for everything that has been said about Pulp Fiction both by creator and critic, it has banal hooks of violence and gangs that moviegoers will flock to more than The Life of Chuck's hooks of white guys dancing and people crying in cars.

"**What That Statement Actually Means When You Read Between the Lines:**

**“No, the F1 movie is not a flop.”**  
**Translation:** It didn’t completely tank and embarrass us in front of the public. But we know people are asking because it’s underperforming by blockbuster standards, so we’re getting ahead of the narrative.

---

**“It’s actually a major box office success for Apple Studios, becoming their highest-grossing film to date.”**  
**Translation:** Relative to Apple’s own limited movie slate — which includes a few modestly-performing theatrical releases like *Napoleon* and *Killers of the Flower Moon* — it’s the biggest one they’ve had. But that’s a super low bar. Neither of those films was a box office hit by old Hollywood standards either.

---

**“It has grossed over $293 million worldwide after ten days of release.”**  
**Translation:** It made $293M — which sounds like a lot — but for a movie that cost around $250–300M to produce and market, that’s nowhere near enough to be profitable off ticket sales alone. Traditionally, it would need $600–700M theatrical to break even, depending on marketing spend and revenue splits with theaters.

---

**“Surpassing previous hits like Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon.”**  
**Translation:** Compared to other underwhelming or modestly successful Apple theatrical releases, this is bigger. But those films were financial losses in theaters too — Apple covers it by framing them as “prestige” or “streaming plays.”

---

**“The film also had a strong opening weekend, earning $144 million.”**  
**Translation:** It front-loaded well — meaning curiosity and F1 hype got people to theaters opening weekend. But what matters is the second, third, fourth-week drop-offs. And whether it can sustain enough legs to recover that monster budget. Which it likely won’t.

---

**What They Carefully Avoid Saying:**  
- **What the movie cost.** They don’t tell you it cost $250–300M+ with marketing.  
- **Whether it’s actually profitable theatrically.** They don’t say it’s made a profit — because it hasn’t.  
- **Whether it met financial expectations by normal Hollywood standards.** They frame it as a success relative to a weak field of other Apple theatrical films, not against blockbuster standards.

---

**Real Talk:**  

If *F1: The Movie* were made by Warner Bros, Paramount, or Universal for $250M, making $293M in 10 days wouldn’t be labeled a “major box office success.”  
It would be called *“a soft start for a pricey gamble”* or *“needs strong legs to justify its budget.”*

But because Apple’s strategy is different — they make prestige content for Apple TV+, use theatrical to legitimize their film division, and boost brand prestige — it gets spun as a “success.”",Statement Actually Means Read Lines No F movie not flop Translation didnt completely tank embarrass us front public know people asking underperforming blockbuster standards so getting ahead narrative actually major box office success Apple Studios becoming highestgrossing film date Translation Relative Apples own limited movie slate includes few modestlyperforming theatrical releases like Napoleon Killers Flower Moon biggest one theyve thats super low bar Neither films box office hit old Hollywood standards either grossed million worldwide ten days release Translation made M sounds like lot movie cost around M produce market thats nowhere near enough profitable ticket sales alone Traditionally would need M theatrical break even depending marketing spend revenue splits theaters Surpassing previous hits like Killers Flower Moon Napoleon Translation Compared other underwhelming modestly successful Apple theatrical releases bigger films financial losses theaters too Apple covers framing prestige streaming plays film also strong opening weekend earning million Translation frontloaded well meaning curiosity F hype got people theaters opening weekend matters second third fourthweek dropoffs whether can sustain enough legs recover monster budget likely wont Carefully Avoid Saying movie cost dont tell cost M marketing Whether actually profitable theatrically dont say made profit hasnt Whether met financial expectations normal Hollywood standards frame success relative weak field other Apple theatrical films not blockbuster standards Real Talk F Movie made Warner Bros Paramount Universal M making M days wouldnt labeled major box office success would called soft start pricey gamble needs strong legs justify budget Apples strategy different make prestige content Apple TV use theatrical legitimize film division boost brand prestige gets spun success,Positive

Dantes in the novel is basically a superhero.

He has virtually unlimited wealth, is linked with various bandits and other underworld elements and learns more from the Abbe than most people in Europe at the time could imagine knowing.

He also does have a ""training montage"" of sorts, or at least events in the cell that could be easily see as ripe for one. It makes sense that you'd depict him learning everything from the Abbe while locked up in that manner.

"Disagree about Hayde's character. She is not Count's equal. He manipulates her, uses her as an instrument, puts the right buttons (scene in an opera with Morcerf for example). Without him there wont be her revenge. And where in the text does she encourages him? Dumas should have made her character deeper and more developed, because she's kind a cartoon. And how does she get anything she wanted, if man she loves, declares her as another or second Mercedes? But from the other hand, she loves Count as a slave (though technically she's not), so maybe that's more than enough for her. So not sure about ""perfect match"". Though for wrecked, ruined man, she will certainly give some peace and relief.

The one who is Counts equal is Mercedes. Classy woman. She was the one who ""beaten"" him on his own field, with his own methods. And she decided, whether he would live or die. He will never forget her. But I understand that it's impossible for them to be back together.

As for Albert, he isn't such a simple character. Somehow he resembles young Edmond. After kidnapping story he began to like him more and more. And through his connection and interaction with Albert is based the whole second part of the book.

P.S. Don't be hopeful about new series with Sam Claflin, I think you will be really disappointed.

"I gave up on this film around Edmond meeting the Abbe. By then, Noitier had been transformed into Angele at the expense of Vilifort's character, Fernand's motivations were almost nonexistant, and there is almost nothing of substance to the priest who just hands Edmond the solution to why he's even there and is just like ""I'll teach you all this stuff if you want, nbd"". Malnourished and starving Edmond seemingly trains himself and builds his physique and fighting skills without the priest's costly choice of training Edmond to kill against his will or to dig alone. Turned it off at that point.

The 2002 one is not only significantly better but also does a great job at taking a lot of the drudgery of the business dealings where Edmond sets up his financial traps for those he wants revenge on and condensing them to a select handful of events that quickly move the plot forward where the book itself begins to drag.",gave film around Edmond meeting Abbe Noitier transformed Angele expense Viliforts character Fernands motivations almost nonexistant almost nothing substance priest just hands Edmond solution hes even just like Ill teach stuff want nbd Malnourished starving Edmond seemingly trains builds physique fighting skills without priests costly choice training Edmond kill will dig alone Turned point one not only significantly better also great job taking lot drudgery business dealings Edmond sets financial traps wants revenge condensing select handful events quickly move plot forward book begins drag,Positive

"This has honestly been the most disappoiting book adaptation I have ever seen. I saw the movie had a high score on letterboxd (4.1/5) and I wanted to watch It. Having never read the book, and not wanting to spoil such a classic for myself, I read the book first. So I spent 2 weeks reading this big amazing book influenced by the idea of seeing this movie and connecting with It only to be fucking majorly dissapointed. 

What I loved most about this book, and what I was the most excited to see portrayed in the new film adaptation, is the way Edmond Dantès ceases to be the protagonist the moment he realizes who betrayed him and ruined his life. As soon as Dantès is settled and has his revenge meticulously planned, the story shifts entirely to the perspectives of those who wronged him. He becomes almost like a spirit, an instrument of fate, existing solely to exact his vengeance. 

Here, he is a dude who plots and schemes with other people in a damn basement room or whatever, putting on masks and stuff. His essence is lost entirely. In the book there is no Edmond Dantes after dungeons, no accomplices, there is only The Count, and he is a **caricature** of himself in this movie.",honestly most disappoiting book adaptation ever seen saw movie high score letterboxd wanted watch never read book not wanting spoil such classic read book first So spent weeks reading big amazing book influenced idea seeing movie connecting only fucking majorly dissapointed loved most book most excited see portrayed new film adaptation way Edmond Dants ceases protagonist moment realizes betrayed ruined life soon Dants settled revenge meticulously planned story shifts entirely perspectives wronged becomes almost like spirit instrument fate existing solely exact vengeance dude plots schemes other people damn basement room whatever putting masks stuff essence lost entirely book no Edmond Dantes dungeons no accomplices only Count caricature movie,Positive

"Watched the movie on a long-flight. I find it decent.

One cannot expect a 2.5-3 hour long movie to include all details of the book. As you said there are many more complexities. 

It is also a little harder to appease all young viewers internationally in the year of 2024. It is hard to get them understand the situation in 250 years ago. So there would be a need of some short scenes which would look cheap. Dumas didnt write the book today. He had the oppurtunity to write tons of pages to explain the setting and omitted some as people would know what certain clothes, sayings, resources would mean.

In a short movie form, 2024, you cannot imply rich-Dantes' resources, or plan or training similar to a book. Perhaps you need that shooting range scene.

"This is what the 2024 film understands, a certain level of advancement compared to the overly saccharine endings promoted by films that in fact lose any sense of the story’s dimension and, like the film with Caviziel , give Dantès a fairytale ending. This is truly unthinkable. When the Count returns to the Island of Monte Cristo for the last time, two men and a boy are dead, another is mad, and many others, with their children and their wives, are bankrupt, imprisoned or, in one way or another, ruined, and he is avenged. And yet, he is not completely happy. Edmond Dantès was a good boy, but Edmond Dantès is no more. He has aged decades in years. He is exhausted, he has become cynical, calculating, cold, bitter. Fourteen years of his life have been taken from him, those he loved most have died or are beyond his reach and beyond any affection that might have remained for him. He has suffered enough. And there is no revenge or fortune in the world that can heal his soul, not completely. And that is how it has to be. And that is what the 2024 movie tries to do, which, at first, could be good. The problem is that your understanding of the story stops there, and you fail to see the much bigger and more important message that Dumas so brilliantly wrote.

Which goes against the  
logic of the book itself, since the man Mercedes loved is already dead.

""— I need nothing, I  
live between two tombs: one is that of Edmond Dantès , long dead; I loved him!  
That word no longer suits my withered lip, but my heart still remembers it, and  
for nothing in the world would I want to lose that memory from my heart. The  
other is that of a man whom Edmond Dantès killed. I approve of the murder, but  
my duty is to pray for the dead."" - Chapter 112

The great mistake of  
Monte Cristo adaptors throughout the history of these adaptations has been to  
give it a happy ending so saccharine that it must be at least a little annoying  
to anyone who has paid any attention, because it is not true. This film tries  
to correct that – and its *great* mistake is to go too far in the other direction.  
For, despite all that, the ending of Dumas's “The Count of Monte Cristo” is *still* a  
happy ending – just not a sickening one.

 The 2002 version  
seems to have wanted to imitate the ending of the odyssey by Homer. Edmond and  
Mercedes made a copy of Ulysses Penelope , even when they had changed and there  
was magic on both sides, Edmond because Mercedes married one of those  
responsible for his imprisonment and Mercedes because Edmond tried to kill her  
son in a duel.",film understands certain level advancement compared overly saccharine endings promoted films fact lose sense storys dimension like film Caviziel give Dants fairytale ending truly unthinkable Count returns Island Monte Cristo last time two men boy dead another mad many others children wives bankrupt imprisoned one way another ruined avenged yet not completely happy Edmond Dants good boy Edmond Dants no more aged decades years exhausted become cynical calculating cold bitter Fourteen years life taken loved most died beyond reach beyond affection might remained suffered enough no revenge fortune world can heal soul not completely movie tries first could good problem understanding story stops fail see much bigger more important message Dumas so brilliantly wrote goes logic book since man Mercedes loved already dead need nothing live two tombs one Edmond Dants long dead loved word no longer suits withered lip heart still remembers nothing world would want lose memory heart other man Edmond Dants killed approve murder duty pray dead Chapter great mistake Monte Cristo adaptors throughout history adaptations give happy ending so saccharine must least little annoying anyone paid attention not true film tries correct great mistake go too far other direction despite ending Dumass Count Monte Cristo still happy ending just not sickening one version seems wanted imitate ending odyssey Homer Edmond Mercedes made copy Ulysses Penelope even changed magic sides Edmond Mercedes married one responsible imprisonment Mercedes Edmond tried kill son duel,Positive

"That ""War& Peace LITE"" was one of the worst adaptations I've ever seen of a complex long novel.  It wasn't even Russian.  The casting of Lily James with her fruity British accent as Natassia was a disaster.  Her one dimensional reading of Natassia was simply that of a kind hearted frivolous twit.  Tolstoy's Natassia changes from a sheltered young girl into a substantial woman through a series of adverse events.  Her character deserved better.  Paul Dano did what he could with bad writing and directing as Pierre, but the whole got wrapped up like another Jane Austen novel with a fairy tale ending.  The reality of the book was so much more complex that the BBC series, despite the considerably talented cast, was a pathetic attempt that utterly failed.  Even the bad guys like Prince Kuragyn and his incestuous children, Anatole and Helene, got precious little to work with and in the book they are delightful scheming characters.  I'd say, skip this series and read the book.  Life's too short to waste on twaddle like this.  By comparison, this version of The Count of Monte Cristo comes across as Citizen Kane, even with the various alterations and compressions.",War Peace LITE one worst adaptations Ive ever seen complex long novel wasnt even Russian casting Lily James fruity British accent Natassia disaster one dimensional reading Natassia simply kind hearted frivolous twit Tolstoys Natassia changes sheltered young girl substantial woman series adverse events character deserved better Paul Dano could bad writing directing Pierre whole got wrapped like another Jane Austen novel fairy tale ending reality book so much more complex BBC series despite considerably talented cast pathetic attempt utterly failed Even bad guys like Prince Kuragyn incestuous children Anatole Helene got precious little work book delightful scheming characters Id say skip series read book Lifes too short waste twaddle like comparison version Count Monte Cristo comes across Citizen Kane even various alterations compressions,Negative

"When Edmond Dantès says, “There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, and nothing more. Only he who has experienced extreme misfortune is capable of experiencing extreme happiness. One must have wanted to die in order to know how good it is to live,” he sums up the whole purpose of his story, and all of Dumas’s intentions. Monte Cristo is not a story about recovering what once belonged to you; it is a story about the effect of extreme misfortune on a man’s life, and how it is possible to rise from the bottom to the top. It is a story about resilience . But above all, it is a story about change. The man who survived D’ If is not the same man who was imprisoned there fourteen years earlier. He is much richer, much shorter, more ambitious, more sophisticated. He is also much more cynical, hardened , and cold. Would it have been better to have remained forever the sailor of Marseille, without ever having to endure so much suffering, but also without knowing the many possibilities that Abbé Faria’s treasure and knowledge made possible? Or were the years of pain worth the decades of wonders? The reader can draw his own conclusions, but the Count leaves nothing open: he gives us his answer, and it is a loud and resounding “it was worth it, yes.”

Which takes us back to  
Job in the Old Testament, after facing many trials and like Joseph (Jacob's  
son), the Count went through changes and in the end learned to forgive as  
Joseph forgave his brothers. And like a dark Christ, the Count died to be  
reborn as a new man, no longer as Edmond Dantès , but as the Count of Monte  
Cristo. His personality does not resemble that of D' Artagnan , but that of the  
cynical dandy Eugene Onegin .

In the final pages of  
“The Count of Monte Cristo,” despite all his suffering, all his doubts, and his  
pain, the count not only feels vindicated, but also has, surprisingly,  
everything that Edmond Dantès once wanted and that was taken away from him: he  
has become rich, married a woman he loves, and become a captain. What is his is  
delayed —delayed, in fact, two and a half decades—but it does not fail. It is a  
happy ending. With its bitter side, with its darker aspects, but undoubtedly  
happy. Because that is what the story wants to tell. The ending idealized by  
Dumas does justice to everything that The Count of Monte Cristo should be: a  
story about overcoming and new beginnings; about how life sometimes takes  
completely different paths from those we expected, but that what is ours has a  
way of finding us; about how adversity sometimes brings something better than  
anything we could imagine; about how happiness can not only be found after  
suffering, but is often sweeter then. And, above all, a story about hope. And  
that is what “The Count of Monte Cristo” with Niney fails to understand.

Dumas, possibly  
influenced by the story of Job and Joseph, shows a protagonist facing adversity  
and then achieving a new beginning, after so much suffering.

">How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13

>From three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. 

>On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. 

>With the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. 

>As an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. 

>The film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).
How to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. 

>Inspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office.

Not to mention this is a film made in pixar studios. The quality of pixar has always been top notch. To try to replace such quality work with cheap costumes and bad acting and so soon can feel nothing less than a money grab.

If they had taken the time to make sure the costumes actually looked good (and peoples hair don't show under their wigs ...several astrid scenes) and perhaps had halfway decent acting it might be fine. But its not even play worthy.

With HTTYD, where is the room for improvement? The movie is 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, it was just a solid, well made, extremely high quality movie. There's almost nothing to improve on, so the only changes you can make are changes just for the sake of making changes (see: Avatar the Last Airbender, The Lion King).

Can we agree that movie is inferior in every way to the original? It doesn’t have the same charm as the animated film, the musical notes don’t hit the same and the less said about the weird expressionless characters the better 

Yet it still made alot of money because of what you said, nostalgia. You aren’t worried about the quality of the film if it makes you relive the same moments the original one did even if they aren’t as good.

Karate Kid: Legacy is different. All it really is is a sequel. Chan's Karate Kid is a stand-alone movie, but it can comfortably live alongside the canon of the original series. Thus, the upcoming KK is just another entry in the same series in the same way that Ballerina is another entry, if an off-shoot. So... maybe you could call it a ""Spin-quel""?

Someone below brought up Star Wars VII as an example of a ""Re-quel"" and I don't really agree with that either. After all, it is Episode 7. That'd be like calling Episode 1 a Re-quel (or a Pre-re-quel).

"(Also thinking too hard about this) I would argue up until this point the Jackie Chan Karate Kid was really just considered a modern-day reboot in China.  I don't believe it was officially confirmed to be the same universe until this movie was announced, which I would say qualifies Legends as a unique re-sequel since it's the thing officially bringing the reboot into the same canon as the original.  It is definitively a sequel to Chan's and another entry in the mainline Karate Kid franchise, which were previously implied to be separate.

No Way Home is a weird circumstance since it's a sequel to one franchise that acknowledges other franchises as separate entities and different universes.  I'd call it a crossover sequel since it creates a shared canon but I don't think it can reasonably be said to be a sequel Tobey and Andrew's franchises, only Tom's since the others are visitors from other universes.

When people say requel I think they're blending the line between sequel and reboot.  It's a spiritual reboot that's still technically in the same universe and has sequel elements.  Scream 5 refers to itself as such: new batch of main characters but the original characters still come back.  The new Ghostbusters would also apply.  Force Awakens sort of has that quality since the plot and general strokes of it are kind of like a soft reboot of the original film but I feel like it's more arguably a direct sequel, just with a similar story and characters. Legacy sequel is also a term that muddies the waters here, it's pretty close to requel but I feel like the main difference is a lot of time passing between entries, more applicable to Ghostbusters than Scream.  All of this is under the same umbrella as sequel, though, it's just an additional distinction.",Also thinking too hard would argue point Jackie Chan Karate Kid really just considered modernday reboot China dont believe officially confirmed same universe movie announced would say qualifies Legends unique resequel since thing officially bringing reboot same canon original definitively sequel Chans another entry mainline Karate Kid franchise previously implied separate No Way Home weird circumstance since sequel one franchise acknowledges other franchises separate entities different universes Id call crossover sequel since creates shared canon dont think can reasonably said sequel Tobey Andrews franchises only Toms since others visitors other universes people say requel think theyre blending line sequel reboot spiritual reboot thats still technically same universe sequel elements Scream refers such new batch main characters original characters still come back new Ghostbusters would also apply Force Awakens sort quality since plot general strokes kind like soft reboot original film feel like more arguably direct sequel just similar story characters Legacy sequel also term muddies waters pretty close requel feel like main difference lot time passing entries more applicable Ghostbusters than Scream same umbrella sequel though just additional distinction,Positive

The thing that really bugs me is when I'm looking forward to a what seems like a decent adult-oriented war movie (dunkirk in this case, expecting/hoping for something akin to private ryan level war ""honesty""/realism/gruesomeness) to then see its pg13.

"> but why title it ""widest releases"" if the actual list just categorizes them all as ""pretty wide"" ?

I'm baffled as to where you're getting that as all of the films listed are scheduled to receive the widest-possible release (meaning people in Peoria can see it in their local multiplex on the same release day as people in NY/LA.) 

As opposed to ""limited release"" (meaning people in Peoria are almost certainly shit out of luck and must wait for ""alternate"" means by which to view the film [be it home video/ppv/streaming/cable/pirate bay, whatever.])",title widest releases actual list just categorizes pretty wide Im baffled youre getting films listed scheduled receive widestpossible release meaning people Peoria can see local multiplex same release day people NYLA opposed limited release meaning people Peoria almost certainly shit luck must wait alternate means view film home videoppvstreamingcablepirate bay whatever,Negative
"I don't know how I can make it more clear. The guy made a list to show the widest releases but it has no way of showing which releases are widest.

That's like if I made a list of the highest grossing movies and it was just a list of every movie that came out in theaters, ordered by release date without their boxoffice gross listed. Because hey, they all are *somewhere* on the highest grossing list, right?",dont know can make more clear guy made list show widest releases no way showing releases widest Thats like made list highest grossing movies just list every movie came theaters ordered release date without boxoffice gross listed hey somewhere highest grossing list right,Positive
">  a list to show the widest releases but it has no way of showing which releases are widest.

Rule of thumb: a movie is generally considered to be in ""wide"" release when it opens/plays in more than 600 theaters simultaneously. A film is generally considered to be in ""limited"" release when it it opens/plays in less than 600 theaters 

All of those films currently have/will have agreements to open in over 1500 theaters U.S.A.-wide on day one (with the vast majority over 2,000.)

"And if this list was called a list of wide releases that would mean something.

Widest and wide are different words. The prefix ""-est"" implies the most intense degree or most high quantity. Yet this list does not list the degree or quantity to which the releases are wide. So it fails as a list of widest releases.
